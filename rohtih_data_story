Entrepreneur or Artist ?

When we think about an entrepreneur, we imagine a driven, extraverted, energetic, action-oriented person. 
We might not say the same about an artist. However, there have been several studies comparing the personality traits of entrepreneurs and artists.
Surprisingly enough, all the researches show that both entrepreneurs and artists are quite similar to each other in personality.
In this analysis, we are trying to prove the same using personality analysis on quotebank data.

For this analysis, we take the quotes of the top 100 entrepreneurs and artists according to their quote count. We combine the quotes to 500 words and find the personality scores for each speaker using the metrics mentioned in the introduction. Now one personality matrix each for entrepreneurs and artists containing personality scores for 100 speakers. We then normalize these values and take the mean across speakers to end up with 36 personality scores each for artists and entrepreneurs. Now, we can easily compare these values.

<Heatmap of personality values for artists and entrepreneurs>

From the above heatmap, we can see that both entrepreneurs and artists are quite similar in many personality types. To truly understand the similarity we compared the distribution of the big five personality scores of artists and entrepreneurs. 

<Distributions if needed>

We can see that even the distributions are quite similar to each other. However, to put a cherry on the top we did hypothesis testing on the similarity of these values.
