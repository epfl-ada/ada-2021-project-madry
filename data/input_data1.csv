Q76," Namaste! Thank you Prime Minister Modi for your kind words and for the incredible hospitality you have shown me and my wife Michelle on this visit and let me say to the people of India how honoured I am to be the first American President to join you for Republic Day; and I'm told that this is also the first ever Radio address by an Indian Prime Minister and an American President together, so we're making a lot of history in a short time. Now to the people of India listening all across this great nation. It's wonderful to be able to speak you directly. We just come from discussions in which we affirmed that India and the United States are natural partners, because we have so much in common. We are two great democracies, two innovative economies, two diverse societies dedicated to empowering individuals. We are linked together by millions of proud Indian Americans who still have family and carry on traditions from India. And I want to say to the Prime Minister how much I appreciate your strong personal commitment to strengthening the relationship between these two countries. People are very excited in the United States about the energy that Prime Minister Modi is bringing to efforts in this country to reduce extreme poverty and lift people up, to empower women, to provide access to electricity, and clean energy and invest in infrastructure, and the education system. And on all these issues, we want to be partners. Because many of the efforts that I am promoting inside the United States to make sure that the young people get the best education possible, to make sure that the ordinary people are properly compensated for their labour, and paid fair wages, and have job security and health care. These are the same kinds of issues that Prime Minister Modi, I know cares so deeply about here. And I think there's a common theme in these issues. It gives us a chance to reaffirm what Gandhi ji reminded us, should be a central aim of our lives. And that is, we should endeavour to seek God through service of humanity because God is in everyone. So these shared values, these convictions, are a large part of why I am so committed to this relationship. I believe that if the United States and India join together on the world stage around these values, then not only will our peoples be better off, but I think the world will be more prosperous and more peaceful and more secure for the future. So thank you so much Mr. Prime Minister, for giving me this opportunity to be with you here today. All Americans should be deeply troubled by the fatal shootings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota. We've seen such tragedies far too many times, and our hearts go out to the families and communities who've suffered such a painful loss. Although I am constrained in commenting on the particular facts of these cases, I am encouraged that the U.S. Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation in Baton Rouge, and I have full confidence in their professionalism and their ability to conduct a thoughtful, thorough, and fair inquiry. But regardless of the outcome of such investigations, what's clear is that these fatal shootings are not isolated incidents. They are symptomatic of the broader challenges within our criminal justice system, the racial disparities that appear across the system year after year, and the resulting lack of trust that exists between law enforcement and too many of the communities they serve. To admit we've got a serious problem in no way contradicts our respect and appreciation for the vast majority of police officers who put their lives on the line to protect us every single day. It is to say that, as a nation, we can and must do better to institute the best practices that reduce the appearance or reality of racial bias in law enforcement. That's why, two years ago, I set up a Task Force on 21st Century Policing that convened police officers, community leaders, and activists. Together, they came up with detailed recommendations on how to improve community policing. So even as officials continue to look into this week's tragic shootings, we also need communities to address the underlying fissures that lead to these incidents, and to implement those ideas that can make a difference. That's how we'll keep our communities safe. And that's how we can start restoring confidence that all people in this great nation are equal before the law. In the meantime, all Americans should recognize the anger, frustration, and grief that so many Americans are feeling -- feelings that are being expressed in peaceful protests and vigils. Michelle and I share those feelings. Rather than fall into a predictable pattern of division and political posturing, let's reflect on what we can do better. Let's come together as a nation, and keep faith with one another, in order to ensure a future where all of our children know that their lives matter. As another new moon heralds the "
Q6294," Donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwideâ € ¦ Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support base for al-Qaeda, the Taliban, LeT (Laskhar-e Taiba), and other terrorist groupsâ € ¦ It has been an ongoing challenge to persuade Saudi officials to treat terrorist financing emanating from Saudi Arabia as a strategic priority. â € Fast-forward to today, and clearly nothing has changed-except the Saudis are now backing terror groups like ISIS. Retired US Senator Bob Graham, a co-chair of the Joint Congressional Inquiry into the 9/11 attacks, connected those dots in an interview last year with Canadaâ € ™ s CBC Radio: â € œThe connection is a direct one. Not only has Saudi Arabia been promoting this extreme form of religion, but it also has been the principal financier, first of Al-Qaeda then of the various Al-Qaeda franchises around the world specifically the ones in Somalia and Yemen and now the support of ISIS. â € A few months later, US Vice President Joe Biden painted an updated picture of Saudi complicity in terror: â € œOur allies in the region were our largest problem in Syria. The Turksâ € ¦ the Saudis, the Emiratis, etc.. What were they doing? They were so determined to take down Assad and essentially have a proxy Sunni-Shia warâ € ¦ they poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens, thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra and Al-Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world. â € American complicity Biden and others, however, fail to mention the United Statesâ € ™ complicity in the Saudi terror-backing project. Writing about the WikiLeaks missive that revealed Saudi Arabiaâ € ™ s ongoing role in terror financing, the Guardian questioned American meekness in confronting this problem: â € œAny criticisms are generally offered in private. The cables show that when it comes to powerful oil-rich allies US diplomats save their concerns for closed-door talks. â € In all the current military theaters in the Middle East where extremist Sunni militants are waging wars against Arab populations, the United States is engaged militarily on the same side as the Saudis â € the highest, hardest glass ceiling, women in the U.S. remain significantly underrepresented at all levels of elected office. Women are more than half of the population but account for just a fifth of all U.S. representatives and senators, and one in four state lawmakers. They serve as governors of only six states and are mayors in roughly 19 percent of the nation's largest cities. There has been progress in recent decades. As recently as 1978, for example, there were no women U.S. senators. Now there are 20. Still, an analysis by The Associated Press shows there has been little headway since a surge of women won office in the 1980s and early 1990s. Like this: Like Loading...

Q359442," Look, many of Trump's supporters are working-class people, and they're angry. And they're angry because they're working longer hours for lower wages. They're angry because their jobs have left this country and gone to China or other low-wage countries. And their angry because they can't afford to send their kids to college or retire with dignity. And I think what Trump has done successfully, I would say, is take that anger, take that anxiety about terrorism and say to a lot of people in this country is `look the reason for our problems is because of Mexicans.' And he says they are all criminals and rapists. We have to hate Mexicans. Or he says Muslims are all terrorist, keep them out of this country. That's what we have to deal with to make America great. Meanwhile interestingly enough, this is guy does not want to raise the minimum wage. In fact he said that he thinks wages in America are too high. But he does want to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top three-tenths of one percent. So I think for his working-class and middle class supporters, I think we can make the case that if we really want to address the issues that people are concerned about. Why the middle class is disappearing, massive income and wealth inequality in this country. That we need policies that bring us together. That take on the greed of Wall Street the greed of corporate America and create a middle class that works for all of us, rather than an economy that works for just a few. Our hearts go out to everyone. We need to move aggressively to make sure that every person in this country who has the virus, who thinks they have the virus, understands they'll get all the health care that they need because they are Americans, that we move aggressively to make sure that the test kits are out there, that the ventilators are out there, that the I.C.U. units are out there, that the medical personnel are out there. Jake, if I may also say, in this moment of economic uncertainty in addition to the coronavirus, it is time to ask how we get to where we are -- not only our lack of preparation for the virus, but how we end up with an economy where so many of our people are hurting at a time of massive income and wealth inequality. It's time to ask the question of where the power is in America. Who owns the media? Who owns the economy? Who owns the legislative process? Why do we give tax breaks to billionaires and not raise the minimum wage? Where do we pump up the oil industry while a half million people are homeless in America? This is a time to move aggressively, dealing with the coronavirus crisis, dealing with the economic fallout. But it is also time to rethink America and create a country where we care about each other rather than a nation of greed and corruption, which is what is taking place among the corporate elite. Obviously, ISIS is an immediate threat. We need to have an international coalition to destroy ISIS. I believe that the boots on the ground have got to be the Muslim nations, and I agree with King Abdullah of Jordan, who made that very point. but not to understand what the scientists are telling us, that if we do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, you're going to see the mass migrations of tens and tens of millions of people, who are going to be moving away from coastal areas, who are going to be dealing with floods, who are going to be dealing with drought, who are going to be dealing with extreme weather disturbances, who are not going to be able to get fish from the oceans because of the acidification of the oceans. Not to understand that that will cause massive instability in this world, and more conflict is not to understand reality. that's what the cia says. that's what the u.s. department of defense says. that's what government all over the world point out. i believe that we have got to be extremely aggressive, leading the world, in understanding that we have a planetary crisis. and we have got to bring the world together if we're going to leave this planet in a habitable way for our children and grandchildren. Millions of Americans have had their lives impacted by the federal prohibition on marijuana -- arrests, convictions and even jail time. Even when people don't go to jail, the criminal record they receive makes it harder for them to find a job, get housing or go to college. Is this a widespread problem? It sure is. In 2016 alone, over half a million people were arrested for marijuana possession. These harmful impacts are felt far more acutely in communities of color and poor communities because enforcement of marijuana laws is much stricter there than in more affluent, white communities. Incredibly, African Americans are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana even though marijuana usage rates are basically the same across racial lines. As a first step, we need to remove marijuana from Category 1 of the federal Controlled Substances Act where it is currently r"
Q170581," Good evening. I appreciate the opportunity to speak directly to the American people tonight about how we can end this shutdown and meet the needs of the American people. Sadly, much of what we have heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice. The President has chosen fear. We want to start with the facts. The fact is: On the very first day of this Congress, House Democrats passed Senate Republican legislation to re-open government and fund smart, effective border security solutions. After the #TrumpAddress, @SenSchumer & I turned our focus to the facts & how we can end the #TrumpShutdown. pic.twitter.com/mSYoyUOFCZ -- Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) January 9, 2019 But the President is rejecting these bipartisan bills which would re-open government-over his obsession with forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall - a wall he always promised Mexico would pay for! The fact is: President Trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health, safety and well-being of the American people and withhold the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers across the nation-many of them veterans. He promised to keep government shutdown for `months or years' - no matter whom it hurts. That's just plain wrong. The fact is: We all agree that we need to secure our borders, while honoring our values: we can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry; we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation; we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border; and we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings. The fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge - a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened. And the fact is: President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must re-open the government. Thank you. I haven't counted votes, nor will I.'  The outcome, though, appears increasingly set as the House prepares to vote, as it has only three times in history against a U.S. president. Trump spent part of the day tweeting against the impeachment proceedings, but did not immediately respond late Monday. The president and his allies have railed against the'  absurd'  proceedings. Pelosi convened a meeting of the impeachment committee chairmen at her office in the Capitol late Monday following an acrimonious, nearly 10-hour hearing at the Judiciary Committee, which could vote as soon as this week. by signing up you agree to our terms of service'  I think there's a lot of agreement,'  Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the Democratic chairman of the Foreign Affairs committee, told reporters as he exited Pelosi's office.'  A lot of us believe that what happened with Ukraine especially is not something we can just close our eyes to.'  At the Judiciary hearing, Democrats said Trump's push to have Ukraine investigate rival Joe Biden while withholding U.S. military aid ran counter to U.S. policy and benefited Russia as well as himself.'  President Trump's persistent and continuing effort to coerce a foreign country to help him cheat to win an election is a clear and present danger to our free and fair elections and to our national security,'  said Dan Goldman, the director of investigations at the House Intelligence Committee, presenting the finding of the panel's 300-page report of the inquiry. Republicans rejected not just Goldman's conclusion of the Ukraine matter; they also questioned his very appearance before the Judiciary panel. In a series of heated exchanges, they said Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, should appear rather than sending his lawyer. From the White House, Trump tweeted repeatedly, assailing the'  Witch Hunt!'  and'  Do Nothing Democrats. Good evening.

Q11673," Late last night, the Senate passed a tax bill that slashes tax rates for corporations and is hugely advantageous for the wealthiest Americans. These cuts will be paid for by working and middle class families across our nation. It will hit New York hardest. With this plan, Republicans in Congress are robbing New Yorkers of billions of dollars, endangering the health care of millions of Americans, and exploding the federal deficit. The devastating impacts both intended, as well as unintended given the rushed, secretive approach taken in writing and voting on this plan cannot be overstated. To implement discredited trickle-down economics and repeal health care for millions under the cover of tax reform before the public, or even every Senator can be informed of the details in the plan, is proof positive of just how bad that plan is. The bill is financed in large part by almost entirely eliminating deductions of state and local taxes, a bedrock principle underpinning our tax law since its inception. Eliminating this deduction means that New York will effectively serve as a piggy bank to finance tax cuts for other states. This plan is a sham that does not deliver on the GOP promise to help the middle class. It reflects upside down priorities -- it helps the rich and corporations and does nothing to deliver on their false promise to our middle class citizens. The four members of the republican delegation, who supported the House version of this unfair, unequal and economically devastating plan, betrayed their constituents. It is now time for New York's entire Republican delegation to put New Yorkers first, vote the right way and tell their party leadership that they will not allow us to be pawns in a political agenda that inflicts financial pain on Democratic states at the direct expense of the Americans who call them home, all to benefit corporations and the wealthiest among us. Amazon chose to come to New York because we are the capital of the world and the best place to do business. We competed in and won the most hotly contested national economic development competition in the United States, resulting in at least 25,000-40,000 good paying jobs for our state and nearly $30 billion dollars in new revenue to fund transit improvements, new housing, schools and countless other quality of life improvements. Bringing Amazon to New York diversified our economy away from real estate and Wall Street, further cementing our status as an emerging center for tech and was an extraordinary economic win not just for Queens and New York City, but for the entire region, from Long Island to Albany's nanotech center. However, a small group politicians put their own narrow political interests above their community -- which poll after poll showed overwhelmingly supported bringing Amazon to Long Island City -- the state's economic future and the best interests of the people of this state. The New York State Senate has done tremendous damage. They should be held accountable for this lost economic opportunity. The fundamentals of New York's business climate and community that attracted amazon to be here-our talent pool, world-class education system, commitment to diversity and progressivism-remain and we won't be deterred as we continue to attract world class business to communities across New York State. The Statue of Liberty is symbolic for what's going on right now in Washington. The issue is about immigration and the sense that some people have that this country should close the doors and stop immigration. And speaking for myself, and on behalf of many New Yorkers, we have the Statue of Liberty in our harbor, Statue of Liberty, America, New York, are all about immigration. It's all about welcoming people, it's all about bringing people here. The concept of closing the doors to immigrants is repugnant to the concept of America. That's what we've been arguing for years. We're all sons and daughters of immigrants. Unless you're a Native American, you are an immigrant. I know people like to think, well I've been here a long time, I'm no longer an immigrant. You are an immigrant. Denial is not a life strategy. I am an immigrant. My grandparents were poor Italian uneducated people who came here, who couldn't speak the language, who couldn't read, but they wanted an opportunity to work. And they did their best and they gave back to this country. They had a son who became governor, they had a grandson who became governor. That's what America is all about. And in many ways, this shutdown in Washington, to me takes us back to that fundamental concept, which is they are against immigration. They want to close the doors and we want to keep them open. A few weeks ago we received terrible news. Sandy shared with me that she was diagnosed with breast cancer. I was devastated. After the news what followed was a blizzard of doctors visits, tests and discussions of treatment options. Sandy is young for her diagnosis, she has no family history, she"
Q380900," Thank you, Speaker Pelosi. My fellow Americans, we address you tonight for one reason only: the President of the United States-having failed to get Mexico to pay for his ineffective, unnecessary border wall, and unable to convince the Congress or the American people to foot the bill - has shut down the government. American democracy doesn't work that way. We don't govern by temper tantrum. No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage. Tonight - and throughout this debate and his presidency-President Trump has appealed to fear, not facts. Division, not unity. Make no mistake: Democrats and the President both want stronger border security. However, we sharply disagree with the President about the most effective way to do it. So, how do we untangle this mess? There is an obvious solution: separate the shutdown from the arguments over border security. There is bipartisan legislation-supported by Democrats and Republicans - to re-open government while allowing debate over border security to continue. There is no excuse for hurting millions of Americans over a policy difference. Federal workers are about to miss a paycheck. Some families can't get a mortgage to buy a new home. Farmers and small businesses won't get loans they desperately need. Most presidents have used Oval Office addresses for noble purposes. This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his Administration. My fellow Americans, there is no challenge so great that our nation cannot rise to meet it. We can re-open the government AND continue to work through disagreements about policy. We can secure our border without an expensive, ineffective wall. And we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security. The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a thirty-foot wall. So our suggestion is a simple one: Mr. President: re-open the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security. But end this shutdown now. Thank you. We already know that President Trump's nominee will be prepared to overturn the precedents of Roe v. Wade and NFIB v. Sebelius. We know that because President Trump has said so. When the president has a litmus test for his nominees, and only chooses from a pre-approved list of nominees designed to satisfy that litmus test, it is certainly not enough for a judge to prove his or her moderation by invoking stare decisis. Stare decisis and respect for precedent have become an almost meaningless bar to set for a Supreme Court nominee. At this critical juncture, with so many rights and liberties at stake, US senators and the American people should expect an affirmative statement of support for the personal liberties of all Americans from the next Supreme Court nominee. The American people deserve to know what kind of a justice President Trump's nominee would be. President Trump is the one who made the litmus test for his nominee, not us. The onus is on his nominee to show where he or she might stand. Considering the ample evidence that President Trump will only select a nominee who will undermine protection for Americans with pre-existing conditions, give greater weight to corporate interests than the interests of our citizens -- no what -- matter what precedent says -- and vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, the next nominee has an obligation, a serious and solemn obligation, to share their personal views on these legal issues, no matter whom President Trump selects tonight. What was the legal basis for conducting this operation and how far does that legal basis extend. Iran has many dangerous surrogates in the region and a whole range of possible responses. Which responses do we expect, which are most likely. Do we have plans to counter all of the possible responses. How effective will our counters be? What does this action mean for the long-term stability of Iraq and the trillions of dollars and thousands of American lives sacrificed there. How does the administration plan to manage an escalation of hostility. And how does this administration plan to avoid a larger and potentially endless conflagration in the Middle East. These are questions that must be answered. It is my view the president does not have the authority for a war with Iran if he plans a large increase of troops and hostility over time, the administration will require Congressional approval and approval of American approval. The President's decision may add to an already dangerous situation in the Middle East. The risk of a much longer engagement in the Middle East is acute and immediate. This action may well have brought our nation closer to an endless war. Exactly the kind of endless war, the president promised he would not drag us into. As our citizens and allies evacuate Iraq and Tripp's prepare for retalia"
Q6279," Fox News Sunday. â €  Even with the victory, the shortcomings of Biden's campaign remain, including a lack of robust funding and organization that have drawn concern from top allies. He is barely running any television advertising in Super Tuesday states. Bloomberg announced his own plan to deliver a three-minute prime-time address Sunday night on two television networks. He didn't say how much he paid for the air time, which is unprecedented in recent decades. And both Sanders and Bloomberg have many more staff and volunteers than Biden. Levelling his own direct attack on Sanders, Biden declared, â € œThe people aren't looking for revolution. They're looking for results. â €  Biden won about three times as many delegates in South Carolina as Sanders, his nearest rival, giving a momentary respite to anxious Democrats who feared that the democratic socialist would finish February with four consecutive top finishes that would make it difficult for anyone to overtake him. The Associated Press declared Biden the winner just after the polls closed in South Carolina. The AP based the call on data from AP VoteCast, a survey of the electorate conducted for the AP by NORC at the University of Chicago. The survey showed a convincing win for Biden. But Biden made an aggressive round of media appearances on Sunday in an effort to counter Bloomberg's massive spending. He's also working to secure endorsements from prominent Democrats and, shortly after the Saturday results were in, he got the backing of former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Biden downplayed the lack of an endorsement from former President Barack Obama, whose name he often invokes on the campaign trail to voters nostalgic for his administration. Biden said on ABC he has to earn this â € œon my own. â €  The South Carolina primary was the first major test of the candidates' appeal among black voters. That courtship continued Sunday in Selma. A number of states that vote on Super Tuesday, including Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia, have substantial black populations. One of the candidates who spent recent weeks wooing black voters, billionaire activist Tom Steyer, ended his campaign on Saturday after a disappointing third-place finish. He spent more than $24 million on television advertising in South Carolina -- more than all of his rivals combined -- but never found a clear lane in the crowded contest. Trump weighed in on Twitter early Sunday, taunting Bloomberg -- as he often does potential rivals. The president suggested the billionaire's advisers are simply on a â € œgravy trainâ €  leading him down a â € œdark and lonely path It's not going to be long if it's this hot. Boy, I tell you what. My name is Joe Biden and I work for Hillary Clinton and whatever the hell this guy's name is. Well, Mr. President, Rick Bloomingdale, thanks for bringing me almost home. I've been in and out of Pittsburgh so many times in my career over the years as Senator and as Vice President, I kind of consider it a second home. And I mean it. Gov, you've done a hell of a job. But Pittsburgh was well on its way before you became governor. I told you, the reason why I fell in love with Pittsburgh back when I was a senior in high school, only two really big schools looked at me for a scholarship to play football. One was Pitt, so I thought it had to be a hell of a school. I thought it had to really be a good school if they'd -- but I went to Delaware. And the first time I came here as a young man, Katie, I was -- I announced for the United States Senate when I was 29 yours old. And there was a big old boy named Emory Woodard who represented what used to be Worth Steel in Claymont, Delaware, my home town, and had somewhere between 5 -, 6,000 workers we had back in those days. And he wanted to endorse me. But no one gave me a chance of possibly beating the most popular guy in the history of the state of Delaware, an 82 percent favorable rating. And I was running with a great guy, but he only got, I think, 32 percent of the vote in Delaware, a guy named George McGovern. And had I been elected, which I was, I was going to be the first Senator I ever knew. And so it wasn't endearing a lot of confidence that I was going to be able to win. But old Emory wouldn't take no for an answer. He used to have a rep in Pennsylvania -- excuse me, in Philadelphia -- Hugh Carcella. And Hugh could not take any more from Emory. Emory was about 6' 6 Promise Me Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose,' in November 2017.

Q4911497," We've been over this a lot of times, I'm happy to go over it again. So, I want to just do a little background. I've been working on these issues since 2002 when I became Chairman of the General Welfare Committee in the City Council. I know the Coalition for the Homeless really, really well. I have immense respect for them. I have disagreed with them more than one time, and I disagree with them now. I'm always astounded when we have this conversation that we don't start with the actual facts on the ground, the things that actually happened. I don't know what's going on here. 100,000 people in the last five years went from shelter to affordable housing -- 100,000 people. Now, I get that good news is not easy to report and I actually don't hold it against you guys, I hold it against your editors, bluntly, much more. But the fact is, 100,000 people already got affordable housing -- that's kind of newsy -- that's not theory, that's not percentages, that's actual human beings. So, I want to give a lot of credit to Homeless Services for the way they've created that, working with all of the rest of the team that works on affordable housing. That already happened and we're going to continue to do that. But look, I care deeply about fixing the problem at the root cause. For the first time, we're able to stop homelessness on a really big level because we're providing lawyers -- you know, real serious numbers of lawyers to stop evictions. We did things like the rent freeze for two years. I mean, these are the ways you stop homelessness to begin with, and we think it's having a big impact. But we have more work to do, but there's no question in my mind that the shelter population is going down because these initiatives are starting to work, and we're going to be doing more. You know we're going to be using eminent domain more and other tools to keep bringing that population down. We're already starting to see this play out with certain hospitals reassigning personnel. I sympathize with both the hospitals and the doctors in this situation. Hospitals are having to take extreme steps to rearrange their systems and workforce. And if they say, Right now, the need is not for plastic surgery services, but for COVID-19 care, I think that's reasonable. On the flipside, though, is the plastic surgeon who maybe isn't comfortable with this -- and that's reasonable too. I've already enlisted through UCLA's enlistment process. They haven't drafted me yet, and I don't know of any of my colleagues who've been drafted, but that may just be a reflection of how well California is currently managing this crisis. I think, ideally, you start this way -- with volunteers who are educated about and have consented to the risks they're taking. And then, if it comes down to it, for the greater public good, you draft -- assuming you're not putting health care workers in the fight without the proper protective equipment, of course. Because who else can people turn to right now? We have a medical education and should be able to help take care of these patients in some way. General surgery is a part of plastic surgery training -- and a significant amount of general surgery training is spent in the ICU. Burn surgery is all basically ICU care -- that falls within the plastic surgery realm. In my second year or residency, I spent a lot of time in the ICU. Of course, there are things I haven't done in years, and I definitely wouldn't be like, Throw me on the vents! Because I could easily hurt someone in that process. But I'd feel comfortable helping in the ICU if I had a bit of a refresher first. On Monday, December 4, 2017 First Lady Chirlane McCray will host the second convening of Cities Thrive, an ever-growing network of nearly 200 cities working together to support a stronger, better funded and more integrated behavioral health system nationwide. Mayor Bill de Blasio will give an address during the second day of the conference. The coalition launched late last year and consists of a bi-partisan group of mayors from all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico who are committed to driving mental health reform on local and national levels. The coalition expands the key principles for action in NYC's groundbreaking mental health plan, ThriveNYC, led by the First Lady. A few of the coalition's major achievements include working to help pass federal comprehensive mental health reform legislation, additional federal funding to combat the opioid crisis, and defense of the Affordable Care Act. Over the course of two days (Monday, December 4-Tuesday, December 5) the First Lady and Mayor will be joined by agency leaders, elected officials, public health advocates and mental health professionals from across the country to share best practices for driving local change, and encourage a national dialogue that strengthens the public health approach to mental health and substance misuse. Tonight, New York City experienced a very... 10 cool little things to try "
Q434706," We need to talk about what we believe: • We believe that no one should work full time and still live in poverty - and that means raising the minimum wage. • We believe workers have a right to come together, to bargain together and to rebuild America's middle class. • We believe in enforcing labor laws, so that workers get overtime pay and pensions that are fully funded. • We believe in equal pay for equal work. • We believe that after a lifetime of work, people are entitled to retire with dignity, and that means protecting Social Security, Medicare, and pensions. We also need a hard conversation about how we create jobs here in America. We need to talk about how to build a future. So let's say what we believe: • We believe in making investments - in roads and bridges and power grids, in education, in research-investments that create good jobs in the short run and help us build new opportunities over the long run. • And we believe in paying for them-not with magical accounting scams that pretend to cut taxes and raise revenue, but with real, honest-to-goodness changes that make sure that we pay-and corporations pay-a fair share to build a future for all of us. • We believe in trade policies and tax codes that will strengthen our economy, raise our living standards, and create American jobs - and we will never give up on those three words: Made in America. And one more point. If we're ever going to un-rig the system, then we need to make some important political changes. And here's where we start: • We know that democracy doesn't work when congressmen and regulators bow down to Wall Street's political power - and that means it's time to break up the Wall Street banks and remind politicians that they don't work for the big banks, they work for US! Far too many communities have suffered through tragedies like this already. We must act now to end our country's gun violence epidemic. ___ Associated Press writers Will Weissert in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in Bridgewater, New Jersey, contributed to this report.

Read More St. Johns County deputies asking for information after man's body found in Intracoastal Waterway The St. Johns County Sheriff's Office is asking for any information, after a boater found a man's body floating in the Intracoastal Waterway, near Butler Beach, Friday. Deputies say they need your help identifying who this man is, as there are currently no people reported missing in that area. The man is described by deputies as white, approximately 45 to 55 years of age, with brown hair and a full graying beard. Deputies say he has a small frame, a slender build, and is around 5' 8 No, I believe in markets. I want to get markets to work. I've seen benefits that markets can produce. But understand this; markets without rules are theft. We need markets that have curbs on them, that have rules, so that it's a level playing field. I mean a genuinely level playing field, so that people have a real chance to compete. You know, it's good that we talk about this in the context of taxes, because when we force those who have made it really big in this country just to pay a fair share of taxes, the point is not punitive. The point is to say you had a great idea, you built a great business, good for you, but remember you built that business using workers that all of us paid to educate. You built that business that uses roads and bridges to get your products to market, all of us helped to build those bridges. And we just want to make sure when you make it big, put something back in so the next kid has a chance, and the kid after that and the kid after that. That's what this is about. That trillion dollars that this real corporate profits tax would he raise is money we could spend for universal childcare, money to spend to reduce the student loan dead burden, money we could spend to rebuild our infrastructure, so that we can have more businesses do better in this country, and more families do better. I want to be absolutely clear. I am delighted when workers get more money. I'm glad when it happens at any corporation in America. Yay. But let's be really clear, if these corporations had wanted to do that, they already had plenty of profits to do it. The idea that this is trickle-down economics at work, rather than just plain-old politics is just wrong. The corporate CEOs have already told us what they're going to do with this money. I'll give you an example. Home Depot, right after the Senate passed the tax bill"
Q22316," International Migrants Day is an opportunity to reflect upon the many ways that migrants enrich our cultures, economies, and societies. Like no other time in modern history, the world is on the move. In 2015, some 244 million people crossed national borders to seek jobs, join family, study, invest, and contribute to cutting-edge research. Migrants' contributions to America are striking. More than 40 percent of our high-tech companies have been founded by immigrants or their children. First and second-generation immigrants to the United States have won 65 percent of Nobel Prizes awarded for work here, and account for one-third of our physicists, engineers, and doctors, 60 percent of our construction workers, and the majority of agricultural workers. Migrants to the United States take risks, work hard, invest, and innovate. They make our culture more vibrant and our nation stronger. In the face of heated rhetoric that can distort the debate about migration, we must redouble our efforts to dispel unfounded fears, fight xenophobia, secure our borders, uphold our immigration laws, and ensure all migrants are treated with dignity and that their human rights are respected. The United States supports the UN General Assembly's September 19 New York Declaration, which established a process to create a global compact for safe, orderly, and regular migration. The compact should improve the treatment of vulnerable migrants, open new paths for legal migration, and maximize migrants' contribution to sustainable development. The United States is committed to advancing these goals diplomatically and through assistance we provide to countries around the world. We are proud to live in a nation that has offered unparalleled freedom and opportunity to migrants, and reaffirm our commitment to assisting those who are most in need of protection and aid. We will continue to work with partners throughout the international community to make migration safer, more orderly, and more lawful. As our experience has shown, properly managed migration can benefit us all. On World AIDS Day, we commemorate the lives lost and communities devastated by HIV/AIDS. We also celebrate those lives that have been saved and the courageous individuals who have brought hope and healing to those living with and affected by this disease. Thirty-five years ago, the first published report appeared of five previously healthy men in Los Angeles diagnosed with what soon would be known as AIDS. I have been engaged in the AIDS response since my days in the Senate. Confronted with the enormity of the global epidemic, we did not retreat -- we faced the challenge head-on, in a bipartisan fashion. Today, we are proud to say that thanks to our unprecedented investments through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in data-driven, scientifically-proven efforts, we are progressing toward the first AIDS-free generation in more than 30 years. PEPFAR also announced its latest global results, including nearly 11.5 million people supported on life-saving antiretroviral treatment and more than 11.7 million voluntary medical male circumcision procedures provided, which both exceed the 2016 PEPFAR targets set by President Obama. PEPFAR has prevented nearly two million babies from being born with HIV, almost twice the number that I announced in 2013. And we now have clear evidence that the AIDS epidemic is becoming controlled in older adults and babies in Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. These are historic achievements that should make every American proud. But our work is far from done. There are still millions of people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS who have yet to receive treatment. In sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent girls and young women are up to 14 times more likely to get HIV/AIDS than young men. Experts tell us that we have a narrow window to change the course of the pandemic. Today, we reaffirm and redouble our commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030, the Global Goal target agreed to by 193 United Nations member states. we have a number of restraints, in the agreement itself, and outside of the agreement, that prevent the Iranians, or allegedly prevent the Iranians, it hasn't been enforced adequately, and that's something the president is going to double down on, is making certain that the UN resolutions that prohibit the flow of weapons to Hezbollah, for instance, that's outside of this agreement, and we will enforce that. The flow of weapons to the Iraqi Shia militia, that is a UN resolution separate from this agreement. The flow of weapons to the Houthi in Yemen, that is separate from this agreement. And if those are properly enforced, Iran can be held accountable for its choices in the future. But with respect to the 24 days, I've heard so many kind of, you know, off the wall comments about, well they can flush it down the toilet, or it can disappear in that period of time. We are talking about fissile material, nuclear material, enriched m"
Q350843," were not completed during the last Congress. Instead of discussing that situation, Gowdy diverted attention by launching a partisan-sounding, personal attack on Schiff on other grounds: GOWDY: I just wish Adam would be intimidated by the facts.... Adam was wrong about collusion. Remember, he said he had evidence that was more than circumstantial but not quite direct.... He was wrong about Donald Trump Jr. and who he called before and after the meeting at Trump Tower. Adam has also leaked incorrect information to media outlets. I wish Adam were serious about oversight. There's a lot that needs to be done in the intelligence community about leaks, about FISA. He's not interested in that. He is interested in undoing the 2016 election results and he needs facts for that. For one thing, it appears that Schiff wanted to find out whether Junior's phone call was to his father, rather than flatly claimed so. MacCallum didn't mention that. Nor did she mention that Schiff had wanted to obtain the phone records but was stymied by the Republican committee. Also, Gowdy conveniently overlooked that Trump Jr.'s phone call, while not to his father, was to someone linked to Moscow. MacCallum didn't mention it, either. The two then whined about Schiff not providing the evidence of collusion he claims to have seen. Be careful what you wish for, Trumpers! The committee has only been up and running, thanks to Republican obstruction, for less than a week. MacCallum snarked, I think most of America would certainly like to know, We need to expose whatever wrongdoing has gone on. That work is going to have to proceed. â   He also let slip to reporters that the additional texts being held by the State Department are on Sondlandâ   s personal device. For his part, Trump has taken ownership of the decision to block Sondlandâ   s testimony. â   I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where [ Republicansâ   ] rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see, â   he tweeted. He also pointed to a specific text message Sondland sent while discussing the administrationâ   s dealings with Zelensky in which he wrote to another White House diplomat: â   I believe you are incorrect about President Trumpâ   s intentions. The president has been crystal clear: no quid pro quoâ   s of any kind. â   Of that message, Trump declared: â   That says it ALL! â   Of course, that doesnâ   t say it all, considering that Sondlandâ   s text came in response to career diplomat Bill Taylor writing, â   I think itâ   s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign. â   Sondlandâ   s response also came only after a five-hour pause â  Now, is it possible that the removal of the Ukraine provision from the GOP platform was a coincidence? Is it a coincidence that Jeff Sessions failed to tell the Senate about his meetings with the Russian Ambassador, not only at the convention, but a more private meeting in his office and at a time when the U.S. election was under attack by the Russians? Is it a coincidence that Michael Flynn would lie about a conversation he had with the same Russian Ambassador Kislyak about the most pressing issue facing both countries at the time they spoke -- the U.S. imposition of sanctions over Russian hacking of our election designed to help Donald Trump? Is it a coincidence that the Russian gas company Rosneft sold a 19 percent share after former British Intelligence Officer Steele was told by Russian sources that Carter Page was offered fees on a deal of just that size? Is it a coincidence that Steele's Russian sources also affirmed that Russia had stolen documents hurtful to Secretary Clinton that it would utilize in exchange for pro-Russian policies that would later come to pass? Is it a coincidence that Roger Stone predicted that John Podesta would be the victim of a Russian hack and have his private emails published, and did so even before Mr. Podesta himself was fully aware that his private emails would be exposed? We are releasing this evening a 22-page status report on the investigation that sets out some of the key witnesses that the majority has been unwilling to bring in, the key committees that have been stonewalled on we questions. So we can see just how -- from an early point in the investigation, the chairman made it clear that his mission was not to find out what the -- but to put the government on trial. That problem persisted throughout our investigation. And has led to its premature conclusion last night. But the work is too important to leave undone. In particular, the American people need to know whether the Russians still have something they can hold over the president's head. The President Of The United States. So our work is far from done. And we will be submitting to the public a de"
Q7173106," We must reclaim our nation's standing as a human rights leader by implementing common sense immigration reform that will secure our values. The greatest nation in the world should have nothing to fear from children fleeing violence. More importantly, children fleeing violence should have nothing to fear from the greatest nation in the world. We must remember that immigrants are an essential part of our American story. Immigration creates strong families and communities who contribute to our economic growth and participate in our vibrant democracy. Comprehensive immigration reform must include a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living, working, paying taxes, and contributing to our American story, including DREAMers; resources to end the backlogs in our lawful immigration and asylum processes; and reasonable security measures at the border. Most Americans support such a package, and it is long past time for Washington to deliver. Modernize our immigration laws to reflect today's humanitarian and economic needs Restore our global leadership in humanitarian relief for refugees End the family separation crisis and evaluate ICE and CBP practices to ensure similar humanitarian crises never happen again Reinstate enforcement priorities and prevent arbitrary targeting of immigrant communities by enforcement officials Strengthen election security Our democracy is sacred. But in the 21st century, it is facing unprecedented threats. We need to defend our elections with better cybersecurity and more secure voting infrastructure. We need a paper trail for every vote so Americans can have confidence that their votes are counted in election results. We need a nonpartisan and fully resourced election administration to prevent unfair partisan skewing of our elections. And we need to make clear to foreign governments that if they attempt to interfere in our elections, there will be serious consequences. Extremism ISIS is not the only group that advances political stances through mass violence: so do white supremacist terrorists, anti-government militias, and other groups that use forms of domestic extremism. All Americans should be able to live without fear of intimidation and violence. Today, white supremacist extremism and domestic terrorist attacks are on the rise, threatening both our citizens and the very soul of the nation. We need to heal the divides between our communities and work with religious leaders, tech companies, and other influencers to reduce hate and extremism in our homeland. Pete will focus more resources on countering domestic terrorism while continuing the fight against international and Islamist-inspired violent extremism. He is committed to protecting all Americans from violent extremists and will never allow the office of the President to be used to amplify their hate or traffic in their conspiracy theories. So this is something that's very important to me in terms of the independence and the integrity of the Supreme Court. As you know, it's especially important for LGBTQ rights, but it's important for access to abortion and many other issues, too. When I look at the Supreme Court, I can't help but remember that my marriage only exists by the grace of a single vote in that body. Now, what I'm proposing that we do in terms of reform is to stop the descent of the Supreme Court into becoming yet another political body. This is not about making sure that it agrees with me on everything. My appointments will definitely be people who share my values. But when I'm talking about the structure of the Supreme Court, I'm talking about something deeper. I'm talking about depoliticizing the Supreme Court. Because right now, every time there's a vacancy, there's this apocalyptic ideological battle and it hurts the court and it hurts the country. So I've floated several ideas and deliberately kept some level of open-mindedness about which ones are going to work best. One of them would be to have 15 members, but five of them can only be seated if the other 10 unanimously agree. The idea here is you get more justices who think for themselves. Justices like Justice Kennedy or Justice Souter, and there are many legal scholars who think this could be done without a constitutional amendment under current law. Another approach would be to have term limits. You know, Supreme Court justices, they used to just retire like everybody else. But now we have these strange scenarios of people clinging, almost seeming to cling on for dear life because they want to make sure that they leave the bench under the right presidency. And this would help deal with that issue. Someone suggested that we rotate judges on and off the appellate bench. The reason I'm introducing these very bold ideas is to elevate our imagination about them. But I'm not arriving in office saying I have the answer on this one. So the first step that I'll do is to appoint a commission with this mission: make the Supreme Court less political. Give us a roadm"
Q1077594," The NCAA and collegiate sports more broadly no longer primarily benefit the players. The current system does more to advance the financial interests of broadcasters, apparel companies, and athletic departments than it does for the student-athletes who provide the product from which everyone else profits. The NCAA must start putting the players first -- that starts with finding a way to fairly compensate them for their labor. Without change, the exploitation inherent in our current system will only get worse. The industry will continue to grow. Big-time athletic programs will continue to find ways to squeeze more money out of their product. They will continue spending that money around the players instead of meaningfully on them. The arms race will continue. The extravagant coaching contracts and facilities aimed at enticing teenagers will continue. The world's largest companies will continue to profit of student-athletes' names and bodies. College sports is an American tradition because of the student-athletes. We collectively tune in to see them compete. We fill out brackets and fill up stadiums because the effort and devotion student athletes put into their sport is special. But, these student athletes deserve more than our fanhood. They deserve to receive fair compensation for their work. They deserve a system that guarantees a meaningful education as well as financial security. They deserve a system that shows real concern for their health and well-being, both during and well after their time on the field. Simply, they deserve a system that respects their contribution and dedication. That means a new system. That means different rules. That means change. It won't come easy and the solutions won't be simple. But, if the NCAA can create a complex system that largely drives money into adults' pockets, we can create a system that does better -- for the student-athletes today and all those to come after. It's about time. The paralysis you feel right now -- the impotent helplessness that washes over you as news of another mass slaughter scrolls across the television screen -- isn't real. It's a fiction created and methodically cultivated by the gun lobby, designed to assure that no laws are passed to make America safer, because those laws would cut into their profits. My heart sunk to the pit of my stomach, once again, when I heard of today's shooting in Texas. My heart dropped further when I thought about the growing macabre club of families in Las Vegas and Orlando and Charleston and Newtown, who have to relive their own day of horror every time another mass killing occurs. None of this is inevitable. I know this because no other country endures this pace of mass carnage like America. It is uniquely and tragically American. As long as our nation chooses to flood the county with dangerous weapons and consciously let those weapons fall into the hands of dangerous people, these killings will not abate. As my colleagues go to sleep tonight, they need to think about whether the political support of the gun industry is worth the blood that flows endlessly onto the floors of American churches, elementary schools, movie theaters, and city streets. Ask yourself -- how can you claim that you respect human life while choosing fealty to weapons-makers over support for measures favored by the vast majority of your constituents. My heart breaks for Sutherland Springs. Just like it still does for Las Vegas. And Orlando. And Charleston. And Aurora. And Blacksburg. And Newtown. Just like it does every night for Chicago. And New Orleans. And Baltimore. And Bridgeport. The terrifying fact is that no one is safe so long as Congress chooses to do absolutely nothing in the face of this epidemic. The time is now for Congress to shed its cowardly cover and do something. From the outset, I have approached this debate with one overarching goal: to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. I cast my vote today in support of the agreement because I strongly believe it is the best chance we have to keeping a nuclear weapon from Iran. Today's vote is a clear victory for U.S. leadership and strength abroad. By rejecting the resolution of disapproval of the negotiated Joint Plan of Action, the Senate preserved the full legitimacy of the American president's ability to engage in diplomacy with allies and adversaries alike. This vote does not represent the end of Congress's involvement in this agreement, but rather marks a clear beginning of our oversight responsibilities. We must continually engage with the IAEA to ensure the intrusive inspections of Iranian nuclear sites are carried out without interference or delay. We must work with our partners on the P5 +1 to verify that Iran is meeting all of its commitments under the agreement. We must ensure that the Department of State, Department of Treasury, and our intelligence agencies have the necessary resources to track how sanctions relief is spent. And we must rigorously enforce the"
Q2023708," By taking two giant steps back for every one small step forward, this proposal simply fails to meet the moment. Arming teachers is an absolutely abhorrent response to school shootings -- opposed by law enforcement, students, and educators alike. Although I'm proud to be a leading Senate co-sponsor of Fix NICS and the STOP School Violence Act, these bills only scratch the surface of what is necessary to address the epidemic of gun violence in our country. It should not escape anyone's notice that President Trump seems to have received a permission slip from the NRA to express support for these bills, but no others. The President couldn't even summon the political courage to propose raising the age limit on firearm purchases -- despite his repeated promise to support such a step at a meeting with lawmakers. If President Trump really wants to prove that his priority is the American people and not the NRA, he should state his unequivocal support for universal background checks, federal extreme risk protection orders, and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. A groundswell of grassroots energy -- led by students -- must move Congress to take meaningful action in the absence of presidential leadership. My heart breaks for Nury and her four U.S. citizen children -- a family that will be torn apart due to a cold and callous decision by the Trump administration to remove all reason and rationality from its immigration enforcement priorities. I spoke directly to ICE leadership today presenting clear and compelling facts in this case and seeking a reasonable request for reconsideration, yet the Trump administration turned a blind eye. Unfortunately, this tragedy is merely the tip of the iceberg. Every day my office is contacted by new families from across Connecticut -- individuals who have committed no crime, parents of citizen children, hard-working neighbors who have reported dutifully to ICE year after year who are now being told to deport immediately under Trump's new policies. America is better than this, and history will not judge these actions kindly. I commend the advocates and the Chavarria family for their bravery and tenacity in the face of injustice. We have lost this fight, but we must sustain our outrage and advocacy until reason is restored. And ultimately, we must achieve comprehensive immigration reform to provide lasting change to our broken immigration system. and nothing here suggests the special counsel investigation resulted from FBI bias or improper conduct. Though the report doesn't validate all of Trump's claims, it does make clear that some employees involved in the Clinton and subsequent Russia investigation communicated to each other about wanting Trump to lose. Much of the public attention has been focused on Peter Strzok, a seasoned FBI counterintelligence investigator who worked the Clinton investigation and was later on Mueller's team until anti-Trump text messages with an FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, were discovered and brought to the special counsel's attention. New York AG Files Lawsuit Against Trump Foundation The attorney general of New York on Thursday filed a lawsuit accusing Donald Trump of illegally using money from his charitable foundation to settle disputes involving his business empire. (Published Thursday, June 14, 2018) Among the text exchanges that have been made public is one from August 2016 in which Page said, The president of the United States just fired the chief investigator who has him as the target of the investigation. If there was ever any doubt about the need for a special independent prosecutor, which I've been advocating for months, there is no question now. Let's remember that we face a looming constitutional crisis, very much like happened in 1973, the midnight massacre. This episode has very much the feel of that chapter in our history, one that we should not repeat. And that is why I will actually be introducing legislation that calls for congressional involvement of a special prosecutor because only a special prosecutor can hold accountable anyone who colluded with the Russians in that attack and interference in our election system and the president himself has to be deemed a potential target. If not right at this moment, a potential target in the future, because his association in that campaign are targets right now. I was both shocked and dismayed to discover that the price of your product, which has not been improved upon in any obvious or significant way, has skyrocketed by 480% since 2009... Due to Mylan's virtual monopoly of the epinephrine auto-injector market and its unique life-saving attribute, it is crucial that your product remains affordable for all Americans.... I am concerned that your company has failed to recognize that affordability in health care is key to ensuring accessibility. When families, schools, and first responders struggle to purchase your product, any effort to mandate its availability becomes an expensive burde"
Q10853588," As president, Kamala will fight to pass immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million people living in our communities and contributing to our economy. While she wages that fight, she will immediately reinstate DACA and implement DAPA to protect DREAMers and their parents from deportation. She will also restore and expand Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who would face war or catastrophe if forced to return home. Kamala also believes we must fundamentally overhaul our immigration enforcement policies and practices -- they are cruel and out of control. As president, she'll close private immigrant detention centers, increase oversight of agencies like Customs and Border Protection, and focus enforcement on increasing public safety, not on tearing apart immigrant families. For Kamala, this is about making America a place that welcomes immigrants searching for a better life. It's why she'll reverse President Trump's Muslim Ban on Day One and fix the family visa backlog. Kamala also will immediately change course on President Trump's disastrous and cruel border strategy. She understands that for many immigrant families, leaving home and arriving at our Southern border is not a choice. That's why she will ensure those fleeing persecution have a full and fair opportunity to make their claim, aggressively pursue a foreign policy focused on stabilizing Central America where conditions have forced families to flee, and increase funding for processing centers and child welfare workers. Kamala will focus our border enforcement resources on true public safety threats through investments in technology and ports of entry to address the flow of illegal drugs, illegal weapons and human trafficking. Well, first of all, if you're not Native American, we're all immigrants, so let's start there. And I would say that immigration reform and the need for comprehensive immigration reform is the front-and-center, civil-rights issue of our day, and certainly California has an outsized stake in the outcome of this issue. We have more immigrants than any other state in the country, documented and undocumented. And the fact that there are folks on this stage and in other places scapegoating our immigrants is really not in the best interest of our country. So here's what I say we have to do: We have to pass comprehensive immigration reform. I know the work that I've done with immigrants in the state of California on this issue, be it getting legal assistance for unaccompanied minors or directing local law enforcement, that they should make decisions in the best interest of security for their community and that does not require them to comply with ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detainers. And look at this in terms of the impact to our economy. When we pass comprehensive immigration reform in this country, California will benefit within three years by $5 billion and 600,000 jobs. It's just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do and we will all benefit from it. Let's stop doing us and them. Let's bring all of these folks out of the shadows and into the sunlight and be true to the values that we have as a country. When Judge Kavanaugh was nominated in July, he expressed his belief that a judge must be independent, must interpret the law and not make law. But in reviewing this nominee's background I'm deeply concerned that what guides him is not independence or impartiality. It's not even ideology. I would suggest it is not even ideology. What I believe guides him and what his record, that we've been able to see, shows is what guides this nominee is partisanship. This nominee has devoted his entire career to a conservative Republican agenda, helping to spearhead a partisan investigation into President Bill Clinton, into helping George W. Bush's legal team ensure that every vote was not counted in Bush V. Gore. Helping to confirm partisan judges and enact partisan laws as part of the Bush White House. And in all of these efforts he's shown that he seeks to win at all costs, even if that means pushing the envelope. And if we look at his record on the D.C. circuit and in his recent writings and statements, it is clear the nominee has brought his political bias to the bench. He's carried out deeply conservative partisan agendas as a judge favoring big business over ordinary Americans, polluters over clean air and water, and the powerful over the vulnerable. The buck stops with him, you know, here's the thing, this is a moment of international crisis, and this is when leaders must lead. The president of the United States was also the commander-in-chief, in a moment of crisis, which is a public pandemic that has led to an economic crisis as well. The president of the United States, the commander-in-chief, must use the voice of that office in a way that is about speaking truth, embracing fact, speaking about facts, no matter how uncomfortable it may make people to hear. I"
Q1135767," Well, you know, as a man that was raised by a strong black woman who understood and taught me from my very earliest of ages the debt that I owe -- from Mamie Till to Fannie Lou Hamer, from Barbara Jordan all the way to people who led us in the abolitionist movement. We in America owe a debt to the championship and the leadership and the activism of women of color. I began my career, as I've said, in a black and brown community. The first person to tell me to run for office was the tenant president of some projects called Brick Towers who wanted me in the fight and to remember where I came from. That's why I still live in that same neighborhood today. And so, I'm a big believer that you can't lead the people if you don't love the people. And as brother Dr. West says, what does love look like in public? It looks like justice. And so, women of color can trust me as someone who for my entire career has been rooted in the communities that have empowered me to be who I am today. And all of my fights, even in the United States Senate -- when I got there, there was not diversity. I fought with Brian Schatz to make sure that Chuck Schumer changed the rules to start showing our diversity statistics for Democratic senators that have moved to get a lot more diversity there. From taking on issues that are loyal to my communities that aren't talked about enough. Like, why does sickle cell research get so much less funding than other illness and diseases that affect less people? Why can't we be a nation that has maternal mortality for black women three, four times higher than white women? And so, my fights have been fights that have shown who I am and shown my loyalty, and when I am President of the United States, these will continue to be the kind of fights that I take on, and I will make sure that this nation is finally who we say we are -- a nation of liberty and justice for all. As a guy growing up, a young black guy in America, who was followed, surveilled, being perceived to be a threat, again, this is just another example of just conversations or lessons that Joe Biden shouldn't have to learn. There's a lot of his record from bussing to the 1994 crime bill. I was in law school when that was going on when you saw African-American men being arrested at rates that were unconscionable. I came from Yale and Stanford, where people were using marijuana, using drugs, but lived in a country where there's no difference between drug usage and drug selling between blacks and whites, but African-Americans are almost four times more likely to be incarcerated for those things. And these are very typical, painful issues to the point now that because of a lot of legislation that Joe Biden endorsed, this war on drugs, which has been a war on people, we've now had an increase in the prison population since 1980, overwhelmingly black and brown. There's more African-Americans under criminal supervision today than all the slaves in 1850. These are real, painful, hurtful issues. Again, we need nominees that can speak to this in a way that heals, that brings people together, that rises us up as a country to not only deal with historic and systemic racism but helps us to come together and deal with our common purpose and common cause. Now, I've been in the Oval Office many times and when the commander in chief speaks, I listened. I don't have amnesia on conversations I had in the Oval Office going back months and months. I had individual meetings with the president and I've had group conversations where there was, as you said, cross-talk. And why -- why is this so important? Why is this so disturbing for me? Why am I frankly, seething with anger? We have this incredible nation where we have been taught that it does not matter where you're from, it doesn't matter your color, your race, your religion, it's about the content of your character. It's about your values and your ideals, and yet we have language that from Dick Durbin to Lindsey Graham, they seem to have a much better recollection of what went on. You're under oath. You and others in that room that suddenly cannot remember. It was Martin Luther King that said there's `nothing in this world more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.' And so here we are in the United States of America, and we have a history that is beautiful and grand and also ugly -- where from this nation to others we know what happens when people sit by and are bystanders and say nothing. When Oval Office rhetoric sounds like social engineering, we know from human history the dangers of that. It's a common sense thing. I was the chief executive of a city. Do I want someone who gets sick with a potential communicable illness to not be able to go to a hospital and get treated, to potentially threaten affect others? Do I want kids to not get vaccinated that are in my country? We've got to have some common sense here. We may think that shutting off people to access to any kind of health care i"
Q152451," Concern about the environment goes to the heart of human existence, of society, of the underlying physical conditions that make human life possible. I would use an analogy to theology. It's not theology in a strict sense, but it's dealing with the fundamental and the existential. And that's why I took such an interest even in my first two terms. I spoke about climate change in the early 1980s, but it's become more insistent because the parts per million are increasing, the climate is changing, the scientific reports -- there are literally thousands of peer-reviewed reports on climate change that simply didn't exist 30 years ago. This is a topic that in fact is fundamental. It's imperative. And I feel that this is something that as a Californian, I can contribute to because we have the institutional framework that was created a long time ago under the Clean Air Act that gives our air board such authority on auto emissions, and under (Gov. Arnold) Schwarzenegger, on carbon emissions. We have a sensitivity here, a value, placed on the beauty of the state. The environment has always seemed fundamental, and not passing. This is more fundamental and that's something that has always interested me from the time I entered the Jesuit seminary until today. I want to get down to the roots of things, and certainly environment and climate change goes right to the heart of what permits human existence to continue. In education, after seeing 30,000 teachers laid off [ as a result of the collapse in state revenues after the Great Financial Crisis ], spending has dramatically recovered, increasing by $4,600 per student -- $31 billion overall. We will also be able to completely fund the Local Control Funding Formula, which directs more money to those schools with the greatest challenges. For decades, school districts had widely disparate funding until the [ 1976 ] Serrano v. Priest decision mandated equal funding for all children. Now with our current formula, the most disadvantaged districts will get substantially more -- not just equal funding. Importantly, this year's budget proposes to link spending with the local accountability plans so that parents can see how the additional spending supports English learners and students from low-income families. Look, it is no secret that kids from more privileged backgrounds generally do better on standardized tests. But the answer is not more micro-management with intrusive state laws. Learning takes place in the classroom and that's why our first job is to support teachers and give them the training and the freedom to teach as they know best. Powerful opponents have emerged to fight Gov. Jerry Brown's plan to streamline affordable housing development -- and their main reason isn't about building homes. A coalition of labor and environmental organizations has come out against the proposal, arguing that the governor's plan would harm public health because it allows housing projects to sidestep the state's premier environmental law. `It would be a disaster for local government, local communities, the environment and the citizens of California,' said a May 18 letter to state lawmakers from the State Building & Construction Trades Council, the Natural Resources Defense Council and other labor and environmental groups. Brown's plan would exempt urban housing projects that reserve a certain percentage of their development for low-income residents from detailed local government review. By making it easier to build houses, Brown believes the state can reduce California's major housing supply deficit, which is considered the primary driver of the broad home affordability crisis. Climate change is a real threat to the world and to the future. Currently it's exacerbating forest fires and the unavailability of the snowmelt that we traditionally depend on. Climate change is important. California is a leader, taking bold steps. But we don't want to just be the exception, we want to be the norm. We want others to join with us and they are. Almost 60 states and provinces have joined in the Under 2 MOU (an agreement to reduce greenhouse gases 80 percent by 2050). That is going to be a mechanism by which the signatories join together to advance climate initiatives and the goals that are outlined, and also to constitute ourselves as a catalyst to stir the nation-states to much greater action as will be required after the COP-21 (Paris conference) concludes in two weeks. There's much to be done. There's a role for states and provinces, and California is certainly doing its part to advance our common objectives. Because, I need the maps. I have a woman, and we're doing the geology, we're doing the fauna, the flora, the vegetation, the oak trees. We've got to know what's out there. And I'm putting it all in a glass case. You can come and see it someday, including the drilling reports and the deeds from the time of Abraham Lincoln. You can see all that. And I'm very interested in recapturing the history "
Q461391," a program similar to redevelopment in which cities and counties could redirect local property tax revenues toward projects such as affordable housing. In his veto message, Gov. Newsom cited the potential for the program to cost $2 billion annually. The governor and Legislature did, however, successfully enact into law a number of bills aimed at increasing overall funding for housing development, including laws that will create new regional finance agencies in the Bay Area and the San Gabriel Valley. Such housing bills include: AB 1487 (Chiu) -- Bay Area Housing Finance Authority (BAHFA) establishes a new regional authority to raise, administer and allocate funding for affordable housing in the San Francisco Bay area, and provide technical assistance at a regional level for tenant protection, affordable housing preservation and new affordable housing production. BAHFA will be governed by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Board and staffed with MTC personnel, but will operate as a separate legal entity than MTC. The law permits BAHFA, with approval from the Association of Bay Area Governments, to place measures on the regional ballot measure to raise funding for affordable housing, including parcel taxes (on per parcel basis) or special taxes on businesses (measured by gross receipts). SB 751 (Sen. Susan Rubio) -- San Gabriel Valley Regional Housing Trust (Trust) authorizes the creation of the Trust, a joint powers authority, by the County of Los Angeles and any or all of the cities within the jurisdiction of the San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments, with the stated purpose of funding housing to assist the homeless population and persons and families of extremely low, very low and low income within the San Gabriel Valley. SB 751 authorizes the Trust to fund the planning and construction of housing, receive public and private financing and funds, and issue bonds. AB 116 (Ting) -- Enhanced Infrastructure Financing District Creation removes the requirement that Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFDs) must receive voter approval prior to issuing bonds. EIFDs were created by the Legislature in 2014 after the demise of redevelopment in order to allow local governments to devote tax-increment financing for public and private projects such as transportation facilities, environmental remediation and affordable housing. Instead of requiring voter approval, the law will now permit the EIFD's governing body to issue bonds as long as its resolution to do so contains specified information related to the issuance of the bonds, and the board holds at least three public hearings on an enhanced infrastructure financing plan. (For more information on EIFDs and related infrastructure financing mechanisms that could assist your project, see Holland & Knight's previous alerts, We are living in a hinge moment -- with globalization and technology detonating at the same time, displacing workers and entire industries. It's not an easy subject to talk about but we need to have a serious conversation about the future of work because if we don't prepare ourselves, our rising levels of wealth inequality will only widen. There is no silver bullet that will wholly solve the displacement from future technology, but implementing the right solutions can help ease the transition and protect the workers most vulnerable and susceptible to automation. Wage Insurance: The federal government offers reemployment insurance to folks who lose their jobs to foreign workers, but no one is offering this critical protection for those who fall victim to automation. If a hard working Californian who did everything right loses a job, takes the time to train for a new one, and then ultimately lands a position that doesn't pay as much, we ought to offer wage insurance to help pay the bills. Portable Benefits: Our benefits system of retirement, vacation and sick leave are designed for a different era. Meanwhile, there are anywhere between one and two million gig workers in California, folks who depend on independent contracting to make ends meet. We like the innovation of the gig economy but that doesn't mean we should reduce our worker standards. As Governor, Gavin is committed to protecting the workers of the contingent economy by establishing a system of portable benefits, so that earned benefits are not tied to one company or industry. California can be a leader in pioneering the benefits of the future. Expand the Earned Income Tax Credit: Finally, we need to expand our statewide Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income earners and for those out of work -- a program that rewards work and allows families to keep more of their hard-earned money. An expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit will support hard-working Californians and alleviate poverty. He's a guy that didn't take off, a guy that didn't turn back, a guy that didn't abandon them. This is a community where a lot of folks abandon these kids. A lot of folks in my line o"

The reigning world champion was listed on the start sheet... The future of the Republican Party after Donald Trump Prominent #NeverTrump advocate and GOP consultant Rick Wilson (reportedly assisting in the independent Republican bid of CIA veteran Evan McMullin) persuasively argues that it is in the party's and country's interest for Donald Trump to -- by a lot. He explains: While Chicago's financial crisis is very real and at our doorsteps, today's irresponsible decision by Moody's to downgrade the City's credit by two steps goes far beyond that reality. Their decision was driven solely by the overturning of a state pension bill that did not include Chicago's pension reform, yet they did not downgrade the State of Illinois. Moody's is out of step with other rating agencies -- by as many as six steps -- as they refuse to acknowledge Chicago's growing economy, progress we have made on our legacy financial liabilities, balancing four budgets without raising property taxes while adding to our reserves, securing pension reforms for two of the City's four funds to preserve and protect retirements for 61,000 employees that were previously in danger, and the progress we are now making with our partners in labor at the other two city funds. This action by Moody's is not only premature, but it is irresponsible to play politics with Chicago's financial future by pushing the City to increase taxes on residents without reform. I am committed to focus on both reform and revenue to address Chicago's fiscal crisis, and we will continue our work in Springfield and with our partners in labor to ensure we will always meet our obligations, protect the retirements of our workforce, continue to deliver vital city services, while protecting our taxpayers. The University of Chicago said last month that an analysis by its civil rights and police accountability clinic found that of 56,000 complaints against Chicago police, only a fraction led to disciplinary action. In one of the most notorious cases of wrongdoing, dozens of men, mostly African-American, said they were subjected to torture from a Chicago police squad headed by former commander Jon Burge during the 1970s,'80s and early '90s, and many spent years in prison. Burge was convicted of lying about the torture and served 4 & frac12; years in prison. Of 409 shootings involving Chicago police since September 2007, only two have led to allegations against an officer being found credible, the Chicago Tribune reported, citing data from the agency that investigates police cases. Late Sunday night, the mayor's office announced that the head of that agency, the Independent Police Review Authority had resigned effective immediately. Emanuel's office said in a statement that while Scott Ando had reduced the agency's backlog of cases during his tenure, By intimidating immigrant communities and threatening to dismantle DACA, President Trump is threatening to violate the promise the United States' government made to these young people.

Q55223040," February 27, 2019 The Honorable Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez United States House of Representatives Dear Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Greetings from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Recently, we heard that your favorite kinds of milk are vegan oat and cashew milks, which are the perfect choices for someone promoting environmentally friendly policies. The science couldn't be clearer: The choices that we make every day, especially concerning what we eat, impact the entire world. We applaud you for pushing for a Green New Deal, as we must reclaim the Earth from those who promote animal suffering and ill health, pollute poor communities, and profit from environmental degradation. Also, we ask that you add an important component to the proposal: the promotion of vegan food policies. Here are some of the compelling reasons why: Animal agriculture is a leading emitter of greenhouse gases and is complicit in many other serious environmental problems that we face today. More often than not, the highest density of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are built near low-income communities, which experience significantly more incidents of disease and chronic health conditions than other poor communities do. Also, meat consumption is linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, yet the interests of the industry -- propagated by millions of dollars spent on lobbying and direct support to political campaigns -- continue to dominate American food and agricultural policies. Many policy choices could help address animal agriculture's long shadow over our health and environment. For example, PETA has called for an excise tax on meat and supported corporate and government initiatives that increase access to vegan foods. Including a program to make the transition from meat, egg, and dairy farming to plant-based agriculture in the Green New Deal would help workers stay employed while simultaneously encouraging healthful eating and the development of green industry. Please see the supplemental fact sheet (available here) for more information. We look forward to discussing how we can work together on this issue. I think that he needs to do it because he feels like -- he feels himself losing on the issues. Every single policy proposal that we have adopted and presented to the American public has been overwhelmingly popular, even some with a majority of Republican voters supporting what we're talking about. We talked about a 70 percent marginal tax rate on incomes over $10 million. Sixty percent of Americans approve it. Seventy million Americans believe in approved and expanded Medicare for all. A large amount of Americans believe we need to do something about climate change, that it's an existential threat to ourselves and our children. I think he sees himself losing on the issues, he sees himself losing on the wall on the southern border, and he needs to grasp at an attack. And this is his way of doing it. But what we need to realize is happening is this is an issue of authoritarian regime versus democracy. In order for him to try to dissuade or throw people off the scent of the trail, he has to really make and confuse the public. And I think that that's exactly what he's trying to do. Looks like they've got composting going on, which is so awesome, too, because composting is really hard to do in a neighborhood like this. We just don't have the pick ups and the ease of it that a lot of other communities have. So that's really how you do it, right, that is such a core component of the Green New Deal, is having all of these projects make sense in a cultural context. And it's an area that I -- we get the most pushback on, because people say, like, why do you need to do that? That's too hard. But when you really think about it, when someone says that it's too hard to do a green space that grows yucca instead of, I don't know, cauliflower or something, what you're doing is that you're taking a colonial approach to environmentalism, and that is why a lot of communities of color get resistant to certain environmentalist movements, because they come with the colonial lens on them. And it should be no surprise that sometimes a lot of these projects don't work out occasionally because our communities are naturally attuned to live in an environmentally conscious way. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is floating an income tax rate as high as 60 to 70 percent on the highest-earning Americans to combat carbon emissions. Speaking with Anderson Cooper in a `60 Minutes' interview scheduled to air Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez said a dramatic increase in taxes could support her `Green New Deal' goal of eliminating the use of fossil fuels within 12 years -- a goal she acknowledges is ambitious.... Ocasio-Cortez pointed out that in a progressive tax rate system, not all income for a high earner is taxed at such a high rate. Rather, rates increase on each additional level of income, with dramatic increases on especially high e"
Q22237," How would I lead this ticket, and why am I the one to do it? First of all, I can't pretend to be in your shoes. I'm in one of your shoes as the first woman in many of the jobs that I've had, and I know what it's like to be in that room when people aren't taking you seriously. But I can't imagine what it would be like to be the woman who was in the maternity room in that hospital in New Orleans that's telling her doctor that her fingers are swelling and he's not listening and she loses her baby. Or what it's like to be a vice president of a company, someone I know, who goes shopping and gets followed by store security, that happened. I can't imagine what it is like to make -- as an African American woman -- to make 61 cents an hour compared to what a man makes, right? A white man that's wrong. But what I can tell you is that my entire life, I have fought for justice. I've fought for justice in the Senate, I've been a lead on many of those bills involving voting. Sherrod Brown and I are leading the bill to stop the voting purges, because if you want a seat at the table, you can't be on the menu and you've got to be able to vote in this democracy so that's my first thing. The second thing is looking at our economy, where African-American women have not been treated fairly, and if we want an economy that works for everyone, we have to make these leaders in these companies understand that if they've got a high-paying job open in the technology field, the answer is in this room, right? Those are the people that should be applying for their jobs. And the first -- one of the first bills that this president, who I believe has turned his back on African-American women, that this president signed into law was a bill I led that allowed more women and created incentives for women of color to get into the STEM fields. Did he invite me to the bill signing? No, he did not, but it was my bill.... And I will end with this: It was Barbara Jordan from this great state who once said that what Americans want is something quite simple, they want a country as good as its promise. Let's make good on this promise. I thought it was incredibly effective because basically, you have a president that's defied so many of their professed beliefs, right? They care about going after Russia. They care about defending democracies. They know that he hasn't stood up for Ukraine. They know what happened. You have a president that has not told the truth, and they claim they want to tell the truth. I really thought it was effective when he said, you know he's going to do it again. There was. Also, I thought of each individual senator, and Claire knows some of these people, but as she pointed out when the former police chief, Representative Demings, was talking about the coverup and she said, you know, over 100 times he went after the whistle-blower. Well, Senator Grassley has spent his career standing up for whistle-blowers. Or when they went through the way that the parts of the coverup and what he had done in terms of putting things on this super-secret server, and you think about all of those senators on the Republican side that claim that they want to make things transparent. There's just a lot of interesting, really pokes they were making at their core beliefs. I just hope they listen because, in the end, it is about patriotism. This is about whether or not you just want to do this job, as I pointed out yesterday, to be able to buy your senate chair at the end and have a trophy on the shelf, or do you actually want to do your job and defend the Constitution. That's what each and every one of them has to grapple with. Today Senator Franken acknowledged that he could no longer serve in the Senate and resigned. As he and I discussed yesterday, this is the right decision. Senator Franken has worked for years on behalf of the people of Minnesota and he has been a leader on issues that are fundamental to Americans' lives, including education, privacy, healthcare and mental health. He has been a friend to me and to many in our state. As the women who have come forward to tell their stories across America have made clear, sexual harassment is never acceptable. In every workplace in America, including the U.S. Senate, we must confront the challenges of harassment and misconduct. Nothing is easy or pleasant about this, but we all must recognize that our workplace cultures-and the way we treat each other as human beings-must change. For Franni, the Franken family, Senator Franken's friends and supporters in our state, it's a very tough day. I want you to know I remain as committed as ever to working together and standing up for people, for common decency, and for our democracy during an incredibly difficult and divisive time in our country. And as we go forward together, we must never forget the words of Senator Paul Wellstone, whom Senator Franken quoted in part today, `Politics is not about power. Politics is not about money. Politics is not about win"
Q260042," I am proud to endorse Cory Booker for president. We need a president who will lift us up and bring us together, instead of knocking us down and sowing division. We need a president who runs to find solutions to the problems that others ignore. We need a president who recognizes the inherent value found in every corner of our country, in every American, and those who have come here for a better life. We need a president with bold vision and an even bolder optimism. I have known Cory since he was a Newark Councilman preparing his first run for Mayor -- then watched as he breathed new life into our largest city. Now, as a United States Senator he is setting an example by working across the aisle to get things done, while never failing to stand up for his principles. We share a common basic principle -- that social and economic progress go hand-in-hand, and must be achieved together. Even if I were not Governor, I would still give Cory my full endorsement because he is the right man at the right time to lead our nation back to where we know we should be. At this time in our history, we need Cory Booker as president. A true American leader both at war and in peace, President Bush was kind, heroic, thoughtful, and of the highest professional and personal character. He lived a life in service to his fellow Americans and taught those he touched with his unwavering integrity. Having known him personally, Tammy and I were honored to claim him -- as well as Barbara and other family members -- as a friend. In celebration of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 2009, we had the singular opportunity to host the President and Barbara on what would be his final overseas trip. Highlighting his place as an honorary citizen of Berlin, I am proud to have had his portrait hung in the German Senate. Tammy and I send our condolences and prayers to the President's family -- his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren -- as well as the many friends sharing in his loss. We take comfort in knowing that, while we have lost him here on Earth, he has been reunited with Barbara and Robin in heaven. He leaves behind a legacy to which we should all aspire. Within a mere 12-hour span, and 1,500 miles apart, we saw the horrible impacts of powerful weapons too easily ending up in the wrong hands. The domestic terrorist attacks in El Paso and Dayton, and last week's attack in Gilroy, California, ought to be the wake-up calls to pull our national leaders out of the gun lobby's trance. Sadly, however, all we hear is the cliched refrains of `thoughts and prayers.' It is past time for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to put commonsense House-passed gun safety legislation up for a vote in the United States Senate. Over the past 18 months, we have taken tremendous strides to end the crisis of gun violence in our state, but we cannot have these advances undone by continued inaction and deflection at the national level. I am proud that New Jersey is leading the way in gun safety. It's well past time for Congress to follow. Inaction is inexcusable. Setting a budget for an organisation as complex as Monmouthshire County Council is not straightforward. Everything that we do is important and making choices which involve reductions is not straightforward. We have developed a budget strategy which will see the priorities that were set out in our recently published Corporate Plan delivered. We are not proposing any major service closures or withdrawals. We have tried to be balanced in our considerations and set a direction that is good for the whole county and reflects the many, sometimes conflicting, priorities of citizens. I'm sure there will be strong views on this budget and that is part of democracy, but the public can be assured that the council is doing its best in difficult circumstances to promote the ongoing sustainability and resilience of the whole county. I would like to thank all of the people who have shared their feedback with us. We have listened to you. The proposed changes to the budget that we are considering are based on what you've told us matters to you. Monmouthshire receives the lowest funding per head of population of any local authority in Wales -- since 2013/14 the council's revenue support grant, the core funding received from central government, has reduced considerably. The largest reduction of any local authority in Wales -- with such significant budget cuts listening to our residents is more important than ever. Our approach continues to be to change, improve and adapt our services rather than to close them down. We refuse to lose our ambition for the county although financial realities are restraining our abilities somewhat. There are a number of other issues where the Trump Administration threatens to roll back the clock, and we must stand up to their efforts. On health care, I will vigorously speak out in defense of the ACA (Affordable Care Act), which has helped hundreds of thousands of N"
Q529344," It is not an exaggeration to say the passage of the USA Freedom Act is the most significant victory for Americans' privacy rights in more than a decade, and stands as a true endorsement of the principle that Americans do not need to sacrifice their liberty to have security. This program to collect the phone records of millions and millions of U.S. citizens was hatched in secret, depending on a secret interpretation of the law that Americans were not allowed to see. I have spent nearly a decade fighting mass surveillance, first working to bring this secret dragnet to light and then working to bring it to an end. The fight to protect Americans' constitutional rights against government overreach is not over. I'm committed to plugging the backdoor search loophole that the government uses to review Americans' communications without a warrant, to beat back efforts to build security weaknesses into our electronic devices and to require the government to get a warrant before tracking Americans' movements electronically. Everybody who has supported our fight for surveillance reform over the last two years is responsible for our victory today and I'm looking forward to joining all of you for more victories in the future. 1.

How many times in each calendar year 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 did CBP ask for, or demand, as a condition of entry, that a U.S. person disclose a social media or email account password, or otherwise provide CBP personnel access to data stored in an online account? How many times has this occurred since January 20, 2017? This is, to quote the vice president, a big fucking deal. Grab the coal industry by its financial cojones and squeeze and you got the beginning of the end. Of course, in this country, the crazies will go bonkers because it's happening thanks to those damn Democratic socialists in Norway. The news: Norway's parliament has formally endorsed the move to sell off coal investments from its $900bn sovereign wealth fund, the world's biggest. It is the largest fossil fuel divestment yet, affecting 122 companies across the world, and marking a new success for the fast-growing and UN-backed climate change campaign. A new analysis said the fund would sell off over $8bn (£ 5bn) of coal-related investments as a result. This doesn't mean coal mines and coal-fired generating stations are shutting down tomorrow. It just means that pressure is going to mount as it becomes harder and harder to sustain the industry, particularly when large financial interests dump the investments in coal. (1) Establish minimum privacy and cybersecurity standards. (2) Issue steep fines (up to 4% of annual revenue), on the first offense for companies and 10-20 year criminal penalties for senior executives. (3) Create a national Do Not Track system that lets consumers stop third-party companies from tracking them on the web by sharing data, selling data, or targeting advertisements based on their personal information. It permits companies to charge consumers who want to use their products and services, but don't want their information monetized. (4) Give consumers a way to review their personal information a company has about them, learn with whom it has been shared or sold, and to challenge inaccuracies in it. (5) Hire 175 more staff to police the largely unregulated market for private data. (6) Require companies to assess the algorithms that process consumer data to examine their impact on accuracy, fairness, bias, discrimination, privacy and security. Given these strong concerns, I urge FDA to immediately issue enforcement discretion guidance not later than August 1, 2019, and promptly issue an interim final rule, pending issuance of a permanent final rule, to ensure a regulatory pathway for lawful use of CBD as a food additive and as a dietary ingredient in a dietary supplement. Additionally, the agency must initiate permanent final rulemaking to allow manufacturing and sale of products containing hemp-derived CBD under the existing statutory and regulatory frameworks applicable to food and dietary supplements. I further urge you to streamline processes for submitting and prioritizing review of resulting new dietar"
Q359888," There is a beautiful spiritual that says `I've come a long way, lord, a mighty long way, I've come a long way, Lord, a mighty long way. I've born my burdens in the heat of the day, but the lord has made a way.' We know this in Virginia. Virginia is a place of scar tissue, folks. We've experienced hatred. We've experienced division. We've experienced racism. That is a sad but undeniable part of our history, but we've come a long way. We've come a long way, under enlightened leadership. We've come a long way, fighting back the divisions and bigotries of past eras. We've become that state for lovers. We've become that Commonwealth, that community in recent years, not that we're perfect in anything, but we've put away the evils and wrongs of the past, and we're moving ahead. And there are people who want to bring us back to it, many of them who are not even from the Commonwealth, but they want to haul us backward. But, what Heather's life shows, what this community shows, what Virginia shows, is we're not going back. We will not go back to days of hatred and bigotry and division. We're not going back. And no matter who tries to take us back, no matter who emboldens those who would try to take us back, we are not going backwards. This community of Charlottesville and this Commonwealth of Virginia -- we're facing forward, to be loving, to be open, to be welcoming, to be tolerant. That's what Heather's life means. And we will honor her if we continue and even accelerate that progress here in the Commonwealth. Thank you for being with us today. As one of my colleagues has said, not a single one of us came to the United States Senate to hurt people, but that is exactly what Republicans have set in motion with today's forced vote on a secret bill. For many of my constituents in Virginia and millions of people across America, this bill likely means losing insurance or paying much more for health care. I spent volunteering at the RAM Clinic in Wise County, where thousands of people had traveled far from their homes -- many of them sleeping in their cars and outside in the heat -- to get care. The magnitude of the need was heartbreaking, and the message from these families was clear: `help us, don't hurt us.' As the wealthiest and most compassionate nation in the world, we must make our health care system better, not worse, for these families. We have to do our jobs to protect the health care of the kids whose parents who have been writing to me and asking Congress to stop this heartless bill. This is about what's right and wrong. This is about who we are as Senators. This is about what thinking, feeling, breathing, believing human beings in positions of leadership will do to help people, not hurt them. Americans -- healthy and sick -- need us to get this right, but Republican Senators got it wrong with today's vote. In the coming days, I hope we'll change course, move to a more open process, and get back to helping people. I support a comprehensive approach to curb gun violence which includes expanding mental health services, background record checks prior to gun purchases and responsible limits on combat combat-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. I've been disappointed to see the Senate block commonsense legislation to address these issues but will continue to advocate for ways to reduce make our country safer. I supported the Manchin-Toomey bill, which would have required background checks on all commercial sales of guns, including sales at gun shows and internet sales, as well as strengthened the existing instant check system by encouraging states to put all their available records into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). In addition, I cosponsored legislation to close a loophole that allows gun sales to proceed if a background check is not completed after 72 hours, even if the gun buyer is not legally allowed to purchase a gun. I also authored the Responsible Transfer of Firearms Act, which would hold people responsible if they sell or transfer a firearm to someone who is barred by federal law from possessing firearms. Ultimately, efforts to reduce gun violence must focus on multiple solutions, but passage of these bills would be an important step in the right direction. I'm hearing from Virginians what other Senators are hearing from their constituents across the country: drop this horrible bill and instead work together on bipartisan fixes to the health care system. None of the versions of TrumpCare meet the President's promises that no one will lose health insurance or pay more for coverage, and that Medicaid will be protected. This newest version of the bill includes a provision that would allow insurers to sell skimpy health plans that will mean even higher premiums for Americans with pre-existing conditions and would destabilize the existing ACA marketplace. I've traveled across Virginia talking to parents, kids, teachers, doctors, and nurses about the health care system and "
Q5386557," I've been talking to [ Houston mayor ] Sylvester Turner, and we sent about 80 people from Los Angeles there, we've got mutual aid around the country. I think it just puts into stark relief that when America is faced with challenges, it is our cities that have to step up and face them, and it is an opportunity for us to transcend the divisions that we have and remember who we are. I loved hearing him talk about immigrants in his city who'd be protected and not deported as they are going through this emergency. Maybe it's an opportunity for [ Trump ]: Maybe we don't need to build a wall but can rebuild Houston and Texas instead. Certainly, this helps remind us why budgets are important. Abstract cuts sound good until you realize they do things like clean up contamination or help prepare for disasters. I think even for members of the House in Texas who said, `Well, we shouldn't vote for Sandy relief,' it might be a little more personal this time when they realize we're all in the same boat. I agree that we always have to balance the growth -- which is good, which helps us bring down housing prices over time, because you have more units, we have a lot of jobs that want to come to Los Angeles, and not enough houses, or housing units, for people. And we need to build about 100,000 units more, and we're half of the way there. But voters soundly rejected an idea of putting a moratorium on that. I hope this year to pass something called a linkage fee that will require developers, when they're building luxury condominiums and apartments, to put money aside to subsidize housing for the rest of us as well, that would build tens of thousands of units of affordable housing, which Los Angeles needs, and combined with the measures that we've mentioned before on homelessness, we could literally be building more units of affordable housing per capita than any city in America. Certificate of Recognition is hereby presented to United States Military Educators Association. As Mayor of the City of Los Angeles, and behalf of its residents, it is with great please that I extend this certificate of recognition in honor of all your efforts for those who have served our country. I am pleased to recognize all that you do for the United States Armed Forces, including bringing higher education opportunities and employment partnership services to our military service members and veterans. Through your exemplary work and dedication you have made a positive, long-lasting impact on the lives of so many individuals and their families throughout the City and County of Los Angeles. Your commitment to improving our community and the lives of our service members and veterans is unwavering, and for that the City of Los Angeles thanks you It's important we draw a distinction in our vision here today, because although many believe the two bids in this race are quite similar, they are, in fact, very different, the mayor said. LA 2024 offers the Olympic Movement something creative and new -- not more of the same. First, we don't have to build a single permanent new venue. That's very important because it means a `no risk, no surprises' budget. Next, we can harness the 100 million people under 25 in America, and the power of our $250 billion-dollar sports market for your sports. And finally, we can help create a new Olympic connection to the world's youth with the incredible intersection of new media, technology and Hollywood storytelling found only in California. Every American deserves to live free of discrimination, and the law signed last week by Governor Cooper does nothing to protect the rights and dignity of our LGBTQ brothers and sisters. Cities should have every opportunity to make policies that affirm values of equal justice, protect people from hate and bias, and uphold the Constitutional right to self-determination. Until that is made real in North Carolina, I urge the City Council to extend L.A.'s ban on non-essential travel to the state by City employees. I would sign that ban right away, and will continue doing everything in my power to make sure that Angelenos' tax dollars are never spent to support bigotry based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The Olympics are in LA's DNA. Angelenos `follow the sun' every day. They are optimists, innovators and big-dreamers. They embrace hard work, progress and opportunity. And they are constantly asking, `What's next?' Hosting a new Games for a new era doesn't just fit the bricks and mortar of our city; it fits our citizens' relentless spirit of reinvention. Angelenos welcomed the world with open arms in 1984 and we have experienced the benefits ever since, so we're excited by the prospect of doing it again at a reimagined Games in 2024. The IOC can have complete confidence that if they award Los Angeles the honor of naming us Host City, they will be bringing the Games back to a city that truly loves them. We fell asleep. We fell asleep when we were moving forward and not looking to our r"
Q230733," There are six judicial nominees on the agenda today, and I understand that we will be holding over all six. I will address those nominations at our next markup. Today I would like to speak briefly about the Senate's upcoming impeachment trial. Earlier this week, former National Security Advisor John Bolton announced that he is prepared to testify when the Senate considers the articles of impeachment against President Trump. I can see no reason not to hear from Ambassador Bolton, who was `personally involved' in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about the president's actions with respect to Ukraine. The same is true for the other three White House officials requested by Senator Schumer, including Chief of Staff Mulvaney. The Senate and American people would benefit from their firsthand knowledge of the decision to withhold aid from Ukraine. Particularly given Ambassador Bolton's willingness to testify, I am disappointed that the majority leader has said that he will attempt to pass a partisan resolution that defers the issue of witnesses and documents. During the Clinton impeachment trial, we had the benefit of exhaustive testimony from key witnesses from the start of the Senate trial. Then, it made sense for the Senate to wait until after opening arguments to decide whether more testimony from witnesses who had already testified was warranted -- and the Senate unanimously agreed to do so. Today, we know that certain key witnesses haven't provided any testimony and that critical documents have been withheld. Given the importance of this additional evidence, it's understandable that Speaker Pelosi has delayed transmitting articles of impeachment until the contours of a Senate trial are known. I do not believe that Speaker Pelosi is motivated by politics but by a sincere desire to ensure a fair process that allows the Senate to consider available evidence -- a goal that all of us should share. After all, it is the Senate's duty to conduct a full, fair trial. We should take steps at our disposal in order to fulfill this important duty. This includes obtaining the documents and additional testimony the White House has obstructed. It is worth remembering the pervasive fear in late 2001 and how immediate the threat felt. Just a week after the September 11 attacks, powdered anthrax was sent to various news organizations and to two U.S. Senators. The American public was shocked by news of new terrorist plots and elevations of the color-coded threat level of the Homeland Security Advisory System. We expected further attacks against the nation. I have attempted throughout to remember the impact on the nation and to the CIA workforce from the attacks of September 11, 2001. I can understand the CIA's impulse to consider the use of every possible tool to gather intelligence and remove terrorists from the battlefield, and CIA was encouraged by political leaders and the public to do whatever it could to prevent another attack. The Intelligence Committee as well often pushes intelligence agencies to act quickly in response to threats and world events. Nevertheless, such pressure, fear, and expectation of further terrorist plots do not justify, temper, or excuse improper actions taken by individuals or organizations in the name of national security. The major lesson of this report is that regardless of the pressures and the need to act, the Intelligence Community's actions must always reflect who we are as a nation, and adhere to our laws and standards. It is precisely at these times of national crisis that our government must be guided by the lessons of our history and subject decisions to internal and external review. Instead, CIA personnel, aided by two outside contractors, decided to initiate a program of indefinite secret detention and the use of brutal interrogation techniques in violation of U.S. law, treaty obligations, and our values. I rise today to express concern with S. 118, the Reinforcing American-Made Products Act because it would preempt California's strong `Made in America' labeling standards. California requires at least 90 percent of a final product be composed of American-made parts to use the label, the strongest standard in the nation. This bill would undo California's tough standard, setting instead a watered-down national standard. Companies could then confuse consumers by flooding the market with products sold under the `Made in America' label that were built using more foreign-made components. That is why the California Attorney General and the Consumer Federation of California support keeping California's strong standards in place. The `Made in America' label should promote U.S. manufacturing and give consumers confidence that they're supporting American jobs. Consumers want to know that products bearing the `Made in America' label are truly made in America. Because this would undermine that confidence and preempt California's strong standards, I believe this bill should not move by"
Q1100710," It is clear that our state needs a more vigorous and more comprehensive and more progressive position if we are going to slow the spread of this epidemic. So today I am announcing steps to help communities contain COVID-19. When I do so, I have an understanding listening to the scientific community that this is not just your ordinary flu. This is a virus that the experts tell us are at least ten times more potentially fatal than the flu and this demands a response consistent with the nature of the threat. We have already lots 24 of our citizens and we mourn their loss. As of yesterday we had 268 presumptive cases of this virus with hundreds if not thousands of more who we know are on our streets who may not even know that they have the virus. So starting today, I am ordering, pursuant to my emergency powers, that certain events in King County, Snohomish County and Pierce county with more than 250 people will are prohibited by order of the governor. These events that are prohibited are gatherings for social, recreational, spiritual and other matters. Including but not limited to community, civic, public, leisure, faith based or sporting events, parades, concerts, festivals, conventions and similar activities of that dimension are prohibited going forward. The three counties affected have been chosen because they are experiencing significant community transmission, significant outbreaks and they are large population centers. This prohibition could be expanded in the coming days depending on the expansion of the virus. These counties could be removed at a future order as well. President Trump appeared before the American people tonight asking everyone to `choose greatness.' He should take his own advice. Over the past two years he's chosen nothing but division and derision, pursuing policies that stoke fear in communities and families across the nation. The president governs from crisis to crisis, imperils our nation's standing in the world, endangers our future by denying the threats of climate change and sells out working people in favor of wealthy special interests. Our country deserves better from its leaders and the president's words tonight ring hollow. If the president really wants to promote a strong union, he will stop vilifying our free press and individuals who dare to disagree with him. He will take bold action to fight climate change. He will work across the aisle to pass comprehensive immigration reform. He will protect people's health care, not undermine it. He will stop using federal workers as political pawns and not compound their economic insecurity by threatening another government shutdown. The actions of the president, members of his administration and his family speak louder than mere words. The State of our Union is strong because of the millions of people who do the right thing every day and put the interests of their families, communities and country above personal gain and empty rhetoric. I think plans are great. But I'm a governor. And we got ta realize the people who brought us the weekend, the unions, are going bring us a long overdue raise in America. And I'm proud of standing up for unions. I've got a plan to reinvigorate collective bargaining so we can increase wages finally. I marched with the SEIU folks. It is not right that the CEO of McDonald's makes 2,100 times more than the people slinging hash at McDonald's. And the next thing I'll do is put people to work in the jobs of the present and the future. Listen, Donald Trump is simply wrong. He says wind turbines cause cancer. We know they cause jobs. And we know we can put millions of people to work in the clean energy jobs of the future. Carpenters, IBEW members and machinists we are doing it in my state today. And then we can do what America always does. Lead the world and invent the future and put people to work. That's what we are going to do. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, outlined in a recent interview what he thinks a successful presidential candidate would look like -- and it looks an awful lot like him -- but fell short of saying he would run. Why he matters: Inslee, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, is emerging as a leading progressive politician and critic of President Trump. CNN included him as a potential 2020 contender, and he also went to Iowa -- the magnet for politicians who see a future president in the mirror -- earlier this year. `The one thing I can say about 2020 is our nation needs a candidate focused on making clean energy and climate change and children's lungs a principle frontrunner issue, not a backburner issue.' Between the lines: Inslee is one of the few progressive politicians who has made -- you guessed it -- climate change and clean energy a central staple of his campaigns I lived in White Center for most of my childhood, and I went to Cascade Junior High School, and I'll never forget the day we were playing football against Seahurst Junior High School just up the hill, "
Q22222," bold in our ideas, clear in our convictions and committed to making change. It all depends on this team coming together to build a movement with the courage, compassion and determination to take on President Trump. Are you in? Gillibrand's presidential run comes after years of the senator being an outspoken critic of the president. In 2017, Gillibrand even called for Trump to resign over the multiple allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against him, all of which Trump has denied, saying he doesn't know any of the dozen women who came forward. Elite Daily reached out to the White House for additional comment on the allegations against Trump but did not immediately hear back. The official White House position is that these women are lying. However, Gillibrand told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in December 2017 that she found the allegations credible, saying, President Trump has committed assault, according to these women, and those are very credible allegations of misconduct and criminal activity, and he should be fully investigated and he should resign. Gillibrand also didn't have a problem taking on Trump's pick for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh. In September, Gillibrand delivered a speech on the Senate floor calling out Republicans for how they responded to the accusations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh, accusations which he denied in public statements. Representatives for Kavanaugh did not reply to Elite Daily's request for further comment on the multiple allegations. â   Itâ   s telling American women that your voice doesnâ   t matter, I think there's some issues that have such moral clarity that we have as a society decided that the other side is not acceptable. Imagine saying that it's OK to appoint a judge who's racist or anti-Semitic or homophobic. Telling -- asking someone to appoint someone who takes away basic human rights of any group of people in America -- I don't think that those are political issues anymore. And we believe in this country in the separation of church and state, and I respect the rights of every American to hold their religious beliefs true to themselves, but our country and our Constitution has always demanded that we have a separation of church and state. And all these efforts by President Trump and other ultra-radical conservative judges and justices to impose their faith on Americans is contrary to our Constitution and that's what this is. And so, I believe that for all of these issues, they are not issues that there is a fair other side. There is no moral equivalency when you come to racism, and I do not believe there is a moral equivalency when it comes to changing laws that deny women reproductive freedom. With this economic package, New Yorkers have more help on the way. This economic package will deliver a surge of protective equipment and resources to New York hospitals and first responders, and put real dollars in New Yorkers' pockets. I voted for this package because it strengthens our health care system and puts workers and families first, with critical funding for hospitals, dramatically expanded unemployment insurance, small businesses grants and loans, and resources for the state and local governments on the frontlines of this crisis. Furthermore, it will give confidence to workers and families facing financial strain and will enable them to follow public health guidelines. Importantly, the bill provides oversight of corporate loans, ensuring that funds are distributed responsibly and fairly, and makes sure workers are protected. While this economic package is a good down payment in the fight against this outbreak, there is much more to be done. In the months ahead, I will continue working to deliver resources to help our country overcome this immense challenge. Look, I don't think it should be so hard to apologize. What we want out of a presidential candidate somebody who has the humility to recognize when they're wrong and the courage to leave from a new position and bring people together around it. Certainly, that's who I've been. And I certainly who President Trump is not. President Trump is somebody who would never admit he's wrong because he's so self-centered and so arrogant. He would never lead from a new position because he listened to his constituents first. We need leaders who have the strength of character and humility to move forward and to actually govern, but I think it's important to talk about issues of race and institutional racism. I have really direct forms to deal with the lack of economic opportunity for black-owned businesses, and minority-owned businesses in America by having more funding. It's why I have a robust agenda for postal banking as well as fixing the criminal justice system. I have a really comprehensive approach on decriminalizing marijuana and getting rid of cash bail systems. I believe deeply that an open public debate is essential to democracy. That is why months ago I agreed to a statewide debate with S"
Q6221385," Well, there was certainly a proposal made by the (House) Speaker and I wrote the call to accommodate every element in his proposal, every revenue measure and every so-called budget reform measure and made the call exactly to his liking and still got no revenue bills out of the House to fix the cliff. By the way, that's exactly what happened in the fiscal session last year as well when we should have taken care of this is not a single bill to fix the cliff made it out of the House over to the Senate. And it's unfortunate because we are now going to cause parents and students to wonder for example, whether Higher-Ed is going to be funded, whether their TOPS scholarships are going to be funded and if so in what amount, and we should have taken care of that. It shouldn't still be up in the air and not just TOPS and Higher Ed but across state government with our partner hospitals, with Medicaid services, our ability to pay for inmates to be housed in local sheriffs' jails and just everything that we do. One of the things that I think people don't understand is $1 billion in state general fund, if that's the shortfall and it is, can only be cut from about $3.4 billion that is discretionary. The only two big pots of money are Higher Ed and health care; precisely the two areas that people all across the state of Louisiana tell me every day that they don't want to see cuts. But that's the only option that we have, which is why I don't believe that the legislature will be able to pass a budget that once the federal reform dollars there will be about $692 million less than the current year. I just don't think they can do it, and I know they can't do it and responsibly and adequately fund our critical priorities. In May, the State of Louisiana, along with 8 other states approved a request for aerial support to our neighbor in Texas. Under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, requests for assistance along the Southern border were routinely granted. This three-person Louisiana National Guard team and one helicopter provides air support to monitor drug interdiction, support anti-terrorism efforts, and provide additional security to custom and border control agents on the ground. This mission is identical to those routinely performed upon request by the Louisiana National Guard since 2010. This crew plays no role, direct or indirect, in the ill-conceived policy of separating families. In keeping with our longstanding practice of providing assistance to a neighboring state, this support team will remain in place until mid-July at which time they will return and resume their primary mission of enhanced counter drug support to local law enforcement and to prepare for the height of the Atlantic Hurricane Season. I like many people, am deeply disturbed by the unnecessary and abhorrent policy of separating children from their families. It is an unconscionable practice that is inconsistent with our fundamental values as Americans. I urge Congress and the President to act quickly to end this crisis. This is a very difficult time for everyone and the impact of this virus is being felt in all segments of our society, but small businesses should know these funds are available today and Louisiana banks are positioned through the SBA to assist their customers during this crisis. That is why I am encouraging all bankers to have patience as the federal government works to expand the accessibility of the Paycheck Protection Program. I know our bankers have been working diligently to access those funds and make them available to their customers but, through no fault of their own, the process is taking some time. I understand their frustration but ask that they also understand this is a brand new program that is being implemented in the midst of a health crisis. We greatly appreciate the relief it will provide our small businesses that are the backbone of our economy. I know some of our small business owners were discouraged when all the answers were not immediately available but I ask you to not lose hope and continue moving forward to apply for these funds. I have every confidence that those funds will begin to flow as quickly as possible. These unthinkable acts deprived three church communities of not only their places of worship, but their sense of security. Holden Matthews' actions came from a place of hate and intolerance and the charges he has pled guilty to speak to the serious and sickening nature of his crimes. I have often said that hate is not a Louisiana value. I have visited and prayed with the congregations of St. Mary Baptist Church, Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in the aftermath of these fires and saw unshakable faith and strength in the midst of tragedy and beautiful love and forgiveness spring forth from pain. I ask that the people of our state continue to pray for and support these three churches as they rebuild and continue their missions. I also thank the hundreds of members of "
Q1124," Hillary and I mourn the passing of President George H.W. Bush, and give thanks for his great long life of service, love, and friendship. I will be forever grateful for the friendship we formed. From the moment I met him as a young governor invited to his home in Kennebunkport, I was struck by the kindness he showed to Chelsea, by his innate and genuine decency, and by his devotion to Barbara, his children, and their growing brood. Few Americans have been -- or will ever be -- able to match President Bush's record of service to the United States and the joy he took every day from it; from his military service in World War II, to his work in Congress, the United Nations, China, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Vice Presidency and the Presidency, where he worked to move the post Cold War world toward greater unity, peace, and freedom. He never stopped serving. I saw it up close, working with him on tsunami relief in Asia and here at home after Hurricane Katrina. His remarkable leadership and great heart were always on full display. I am profoundly grateful for every minute I spent with President Bush and will always hold our friendship as one of my life's greatest gifts. Our hearts and prayers are with George, Jeb, Neil, Marvin, Doro, their families, and the entire Bush clan. All Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected, but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public services they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more, by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens. In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. We are a nation of immigrants. But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it. The FBI director said, when he testified to Congress, he had to amend the previous day's statement, that she had never received any emails marked classified. They saw two little notes with a `C' on it. This is the biggest load of bull I ever heard. They were about telephone calls that she needed to make. And the State Department put a little `C' on it to discourage people from discussing it in public, in the event that the secretary of state, whoever it is, doesn't make the phone call. Does that sound threatening to the national security to you?... And the truth is that it was a mistake for her to use her personal email, even though her predecessors had, and her successor John Kerry did, for a year until it was no longer legal. But she should have known there'd be a different set of rules applied to her if she ever ran for president. The truth is, when the State Department asked all the previous secretaries of state to give them any records that would help them fill out their records-because they didn't have a lot of records - she was the only one who gave anything. Arafat immediately began to equivocate, asking for `clarifications.' But the parameters were clear; either he would negotiate within them or not. As always, he was playing for more time... On the twenty-seventh, Barak's cabinet endorsed the parameters with reservations, but all their reservations were within the parameters, and therefore subject to negotiations anyway. It was historic: an Israeli government had said that to get peace, there would be a Palestinian state in roughly 97% of the West Bank, counting the swap, and all of Gaza where Israel also had settlements. The ball was in Arafat's court... When he left, I still had no idea what Arafat was going to do. His body language said no, but the deal was so good I couldn't believe anyone would be foolish enough to let it go... Arafat never said no; he just couldn't bring himself to say yes. Pride goeth before the fall. Right before I left office, Arafat, in one of our last conversations, thanked me for all my efforts and told me what a great man I was. `Mr. Chairman, All Americans, not only in the States most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal al"
Q434804," Last night's defeat of the Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act was a victory for our state. One million Illinoisans would have lost their health insurance under the GOP's various plans. Our state's outstanding hospitals would have lost between 60,000 and 95,000 good paying professional jobs. More than three million Illinoisans -- 20 percent of people in our state -- depend on the Medicaid program for health coverage, including 1.5 million children, more than 300,000 seniors and people with disabilities, and 650,000 who gained Medicaid coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act. The Republican health care repeal bills would have absolutely decimated the Medicaid program and endangered this coverage for Illinoisans. Two-thirds of nursing home residents who count on Medicaid would have faced big funding cuts. And nationwide, eleven million disabled individuals with Medicaid would have lost the only health insurance they can count on. Under these various repeal bills, every family with health insurance would have seen the reliability of that insurance crumble -- with basic protections, like those for people with pre-existing conditions, eliminated. And those between the ages of 50 and 64 would have seen their premium costs rise sharply. And all of this was driven by a Republican plan to give the wealthiest few, as well as pharmaceutical and insurance companies, a tax break of more than $600 billion. Last night the special interests lost on the floor of the Senate. Thanks to the patients, nurses, doctors, hospitals and ordinary citizens who stood up and fought back. Our Illinois families prevailed. The Illinois Congressmen who voted to repeal health care today ignored clear warnings from every Illinois medical organization that this will be a disaster for our state. They were driven by political arrogance instead of common sense. My recent medical experience reminded me how vulnerable we all are. I will fight this Republican health care repeal in the Senate until Hell freezes over. Republican refusal to secure an impact statement on their bill from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office is unprecedented and tells us this revised repeal plan is worse than the original. Residents of Illinois can expect protection for those with pre-existing conditions to diminish; one million in our state to lose their health insurance; those between ages 45 and 65 to see dramatic increases in premiums; downstate and inner city hospitals to reduce services and staff and a return to the life-and-death battles with insurance companies over issues of coverage. For those Republican Congressmen who are counting on the Senate to clean up their repeal mess, I have news for them. The vote they just cast to take health care away from the people they represent will be front and center when they face their constituents. The Senate won't save them from being held accountable for this craven vote. America is ready for bi-partisan cooperation to improve our health care system not this partisan, chest-thumping, Tweet-driven attack on our health care from politicians who are lucky enough to have the best health insurance in our nation. Only 12 days into this Administration, we've already seen unlawful executive orders blocked by a federal court, and the unprecedented dismissal of an Attorney General for disagreeing with the President. I believe the independence of our judicial system, and especially the Supreme Court, is more critical now than at any time in recent history. That is the context in which I will review this nomination. I will meet with Judge Gorsuch and support a hearing and a vote for him -- both of which were denied to an eminently qualified nominee presented by President Obama. The American people need to know what they can expect from this nominee, and that he will protect our fundamental constitutional rights on issues like voting rights, immigration, privacy, and women's health. In recent years, the Court's decisions have shifted dramatically toward big money corporate interests at the expense of American workers and small businesses -- we need a Court that is on the side of Main Street, not Wall Street. This Supreme Court seat does not belong to President Trump or to any political party. It belongs to the American people, and I will work to make sure their voices are heard in this debate. For the President of the United States to be forced to defend his travel ban before the Supreme Court is not a victory. By lifting Trump's ban for travelers with close relationships in the United States, the Court has sent a clear signal that it will strike down that portion of the ban. It's important to note that this case only deals with whether Trump's travel ban is constitutional. It is not for the Court to decide if it is wise or just. This travel ban alienates our allies and is a recruiting tool for terrorists. It will not help keep the American people safe, and it is inconsistent with America's tradition as a refu"
Q11963798," President Bush was not only a hero of World War II -- brave, tenacious, fearless and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism under fire -- but he was also an extraordinary family man who deeply loved his wife Barbara and family, and spent his entire public life pursuing peace and an end to the Cold War. He inspired selfless public service -- a thousand points of light -- and generosity and compassion for others, especially those in need. As both President and Vice President, he visited my district and the biggest takeaway from those experiences, as well as working with him in Washington, was how gracious and kind and humble he was. Despite being the most powerful political leader on earth, he regarded the issues and solutions to problems as far more important than himself -- truly amazing. At this time of sorrow and loss, my wife Marie and I offer our deepest condolences to the Bush family and join the nation is expressing our gratitude and respect for an exceptional man who served our country with great honor and distinction. Mike Bishop's belated statement about the desirability of keeping families together is not an adequate response to the harms being inflicted on children at the border. With respect to the specific injustice of separating families and the hundreds of children still kept away from their parents, the problem is not `hyper-partisanship' as Bishop claims. The problem is a specific, harmful decision by the Trump administration and the unwillingness of Bishop and his GOP colleagues to carry out the constitutional role of Congress in being a check against the president. Words mean little right now. Bishop needs to take action. Returning PAC money from those who profit from the abusive treatment of children and families would be a small step to show he is doing more than merely saying the words that his advisers tell him to say. Accessibility and Choice allows players to race their way with handling options for both the core sim racer and casual players. Secondly, it's about Glory and Prestige. We want players to feel excited no matter where they finish-whether that's in first place or coming out on top against your arch nemesis. Lastly, it's about the unpredictable stories that happen in Motorsport; it's why we watch motorsport on TV. It's the drama and those the key moments that get you sitting on the edge of your seat. Grid isn't about a procession of cars. It's tight overtakes, bumper-to-bumper scrapes and competitive racing action. We want everything including the car to be able to tell a story at the end of the race through its bumps and scrapes. Grid gives players drama, excitement and unique motorsport stories in every race. It's a game we're trying to grow and develop in Scotland. We want to grow the interest through the national team and the starting up of regional leagues to get more people involved will hopefully achieve that. We'll be running the league every Wednesday evening at Tynecastle High where we have six or seven teams already signed up. There are some different rules that the guys are going to have to get a hang of before we can really get the league up and running though. If you've never played the game before then it's probably going to take two or three weeks to understand it. The tempo of the game is so fast but the whole idea of futsal for us is that it's a real kind of development tool for football. It promotes that little bit of magic or creativity in one v one situations and passing movements. Everybody does stuff on Easter, and everybody does stuff on Christmas, but some don't do it on Halloween. We thought, `What's something that we could do to reach out?' We had actually thought about doing something like this for about 10 years, but we kept sitting on it and sitting on it. Finally, we did it. It's kind of cool. Everybody does different trunks with different Bible stories. Everybody has a different character, along with candy, and we'll hand out Bibles at the end. It's turned into a real great event. The first year it was on a Sunday, so we had about 600-some kids. The weekdays are a little bit slower just because kids are getting out of school, but we still had over 300 kids last year, so it turned out great. It's something that we want to continue to do. As I have met scores of patients suffering the devastating effects of Chronic Lyme -- who only got well after aggressive treatment by a Lyme-literate physician -- I have been dismayed and angered by the unwillingness of some to take a fresh, comprehensive look at this insidious disease. It will be necessary for the physicians, scientists, government leaders, and media to be discerning -- to evaluate the evidence to see if it is based on the best science and to scrutinize the studies and the critiques of those studies to determine whether they are of high quality. We need scientists to speak out in an unfettered way. We need government agencies to show leadership and to forcefully say what we know"
Q263725," OK, so let me start, Steve, with the stock market generally. I mean, of course, the stock market has gone up a great deal this year. And we have in recent months characterized the general level of asset valuations as elevated. What that reflects is simply the assessment that looking at price-earnings ratios and comparable metrics for other assets other than equities, we see ratios that are in the high end of historical ranges. And so that's worth pointing out. But economists are not great at knowing what appropriate valuations are; we don't have a terrific record. And the fact that those valuations are high doesn't mean that they're necessarily overvalued. We are in a -- I mentioned this in my opening statement and we've talked about this repeatedly-likely a low interest rate environment, lower than we've had in past decades. And if that turns out to be the case, that's a factor that supports higher valuations, where enjoying solid economic growth with low inflation and the risks in the global economy look more balanced than they have in many years. So, I think what we need to and are trying to think through is if there were an adjustment in asset valuations, the stock market, what impact would that have on the economy? And would it provoke financial stability concerns? And I think when we look at other indicators of financial stability risks, there's nothing flashing red there or possibly even orange. We have a much more resilient, stronger banking system. And we're not seeing some worrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at excessive levels. So, this is something that the FOMC pays attention to. But if you ask me is this a significant factor shaping monetary policy now, well it's on the list of risks. It's not a major factor. My colleagues on the FOMC and I believe that, whenever possible, influencing short-term interest rates by targeting the federal funds rate should be our primary tool. As I have already noted, we have a long track record using this tool to pursue our statutory goals. In contrast, we have much more limited experience with using our securities holdings for that purpose. Where does this assessment leave our unconventional policy tools? I believe their deployment should be considered again if our conventional tool reaches its limit -- that is, when the federal funds rate has reached its effective lower bound and the U.S. economy still needs further monetary policy accommodation. Does this mean that it will take another Great Recession for our unconventional tools to be used again? Not necessarily. Recent studies suggest that the neutral level of the federal funds rate appears to be much lower than it was in previous decades. Indeed, most FOMC participants now assess the longer-run value of the neutral federal funds rate as only 2-3/4 percent or so, compared with around 4-1/4 percent just a few years ago. With a low neutral federal funds rate, there will typically be less scope for the FOMC to reduce short-term interest rates in response to an economic downturn, raising the possibility that we may need to resort again to enhanced forward rate guidance and asset purchases to provide needed accommodation... The bottom line is that we must recognize that our unconventional tools might have to be used again. If we are indeed living in a low-neutral-rate world, a significantly less severe economic downturn than the Great Recession might be sufficient to drive short-term interest rates back to their effective lower bound. Would an average federal funds rate of about 3 percent impair the Fed's ability to fight recessions? Based on the FOMC's behavior in past recessions, one might think that such a low interest rate could substantially impair policy effectiveness. During the past nine recessions, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate by amounts ranging from about 3 percentage points to more than 10 percentage points. On average, the FOMC reduced rates by about 5-1/2 percentage points, which seems to suggest that the FOMC would face a shortfall of about 2-1/2 percentage points for dealing with an average-sized recession. But this simple comparison exaggerates the limitations on policy created by the zero lower bound. As shown in the second column, the federal funds rate at the start of the past seven recessions was appreciably above the level consistent with the economy operating at potential in the longer run. In most cases, this tighter-than-normal stance of policy before the recession appears to have reflected some combination of initially higher-than-normal labor utilization and elevated inflation pressures. As a result, a large portion of the rate cuts that subsequently occurred during these recessions represented the undoing of the earlier tight stance of monetary policy. Of course, this situation could occur again in the future. But if it did, the federal funds rate at the onset of the recession would be well above its normal level, and the FOMC would be able to cut short-term interest "
Q381880," The events of August 5th were tragic and we wish the outcome of that evening had been different. However, based on the information the responding officers had and Mr. Crawford's failure to comply with the responding officers orders, the officers did what they were trained to do to protect the public. The officers followed accepted law enforcement training protocol in their response to the report of an active threat in the Walmart store. The grand jury review of the evidence and subsequent no bill decision indicates the officers' actions were not of a criminal nature and justified under Ohio law. Although the state review process has been concluded, in keeping with the Beavercreek Police Department's Organizational Values and our desire to uphold the public trust, City Manager Michael A. Cornell and Police Chief Dennis Evers are requesting the Federal Bureau of Investigation conduct a separate review of the Beavercreek Police Department's actions in this case to determine if there were any civil rights violations. The Beavercreek Police Department will cooperate fully with the FBI during this process. Until the conclusion of the review of the FBI's recommendations by the Department of Justice, Officer Sean Williams will be assigned administrative desk duty within the police department. The City will have no further comment pending the Department of Justice review. Housing Finan By Tim McLaughlin BOSTON (Reuters) - Three U.S. Democratic senators have asked the investigative arm of Congress to evaluate a $1 billion-a-year subsidy for burning chemically treated refined coal, after research has shown that some power plants using the fuel produced surging amounts of mercury and smog instead of cutting pollution. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, as well as Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, on Friday requested the Government Accountability Office investigate the tax credit program for refined coal, according to a letter viewed by Reuters. The request for an investigation comes after a Reuters Special Report in December 2018 revealed that many power plants burning refined coal pumped out more smog, not less. After the Reuters report, a study by independent nonprofit Resources for the Future found that power plants using refined coal were not reducing mercury, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide pollution to levels required by the tax credit program. Those pollutants rose sharply at some power plants after they began burning refined coal, the study said. Others showed reductions, but not enough to meet the requirements for taxpayer subsidies, according to the study by the Washington, D.C., research institution. I cannot support any nominee who does not recognize that corporations are not people. The Supreme Court has enormous influence over the lives of everyday Ohioans, and any nominee must be willing to defend their rights to make their own healthcare decisions, collectively bargain for safe workplaces and fair pay, and to be protected from discrimination and Wall Street greed. Senator Brown thoroughly reviewed Judge Gorsuch's record ahead of tonight's expected announcement and found a record that is far outside of the judicial mainstream. Gorsuch's record includes: Ruling that corporations are people; Ruling against women's rights to basic healthcare at places like Planned Parenthood; Arguing against the rights of working Americans to band together to hold Wall Street and corporations accountable for abuses; Hostility toward anti-discrimination and criminal justice protections, including opposition to equal protection for LGBTQ Americans; and Judicial theories that oppose protections that ensure clean air and water and safe food and medicine. The Fed has been without a community banking representative for nearly a year and the industry has pushed for an appointment. Bank of Hawaii was selected as the `Best Bank in America' in 2009 and 2010 by Forbes while Landon was at the helm. The central bank, which has been operating on a nearly constant rotation of vacancies over the past several years, has a hefty agenda this year. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen will lead the bank through plans to reduce its more than $4 trillion balance sheet and raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Landon is a partner in Community BanCapital, a community bank investment fund based in Portland, Ore.. He also is a director of MidFirst Bank in Oklahoma City and he is an adjunct instructor at the universities of Utah and Hawaii, according to a biography. In October 2017, Sherrod Brown voted NO on a bill to establish the Congressional Budget for the U.S. Government for Fiscal Year 2018. I would have voted YES. Senator Brown and I share very different views over how much money should be spent. He seems to be comfortable with large annual budget deficits, even when the economy is expanding. I believe that deficit spending should only take place during periods of recessi"
Q15126384," I have been in constant communication with all City departments regarding the blizzard watch that has been issued for the City of Boston beginning Monday evening and continuing through early Wednesday. Our City has been through blizzards before and I am confident we are prepared. Public Works has 700 pieces of equipment ready, over 35,000 tons of salt on hand and snow farms are being readied for anticipated removal operations. Once the storm begins, I ask everyone to be vigilant, stay inside and off the roads or use public transportation when possible, and remember to check on your neighbors, especially the elderly and disabled. Anyone who suspects carbon monoxide poisoning should call 911 immediately. I also ask residents to remove snow, slush and ice from sidewalks, curbs and to keep fire hydrants clear. Withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement isn't just a setback, it's irresponsible. This damages our nation's reputation as an international leader and puts future generations at risk to the threat of climate change. Boston will not standby given what's at stake. We are committed to addressing climate change head on and will accelerate Boston's efforts to become carbon neutral by 2050. Fighting climate change means fighting for all those affected by worsening air quality, extreme heat, eroding coastlines -- issues that will continue to impact residents for generations to come. As Mayor, I will continue to work with U.S. Mayors and cities around the world to uphold the tenets of the Paris climate agreement and protect Boston against the very real impacts of climate change. I guess, at this point, I don't even know what the context was in that article. I wouldn't say I'm personally pro-life. I would just say I'm a pro-choice candidate, I'm a pro-choice mayor, I was a pro-choice legislator. What I mean by `personally pro-life' at the time was, like, I'm personally, my feelings personally, I guess, I believe in life. I don't even know where I came up with that. But, since that time, as far as a legislator, I've always supported and voted for a woman's right to choose. I've always supported legislation for a woman's right to choose. And as mayor -- I ran as an open, pro-choice candidate for mayor. If I ran for any higher office, I'm pro-choice. I would probably never use the word, `personally pro-life' ever again. I think the role of the party is making sure that we have good strong democratic candidates that continue to run and move forward. And when you think of the results of that party, it's important. The Democratic party does not get involved in primary races. When I ran for mayor last year, when I was running for reelection, I reached out to the party and what they said to me at that point is `we don't get involved.' It was myself and Counselor Jackson running for mayor... I am not sure what her experience has been with the party and I think that its something that as a newly elected Democratic state representative from Jamacia Plain, she has an opportunity to have conversations with the party to see what she might want to see changed. Belfast has a tremendous amount to offer the world and we can see it represented here in arts and culture, in education and a concern for young people, in science and innovation and in the values of healing and connection and hope. In these days of global uncertainty and rising division, the world needs what Belfast has to offer. As mayor of a multi-cultural city, working to build a future for all our people, I am drawn here because of these qualities. And together, we have learned that building the relationship between our cities strengthens us and helps us all. I don't think I exaggerate when I say that as nations struggle against the pull of the past, cities working together can lead the world forward. Hosting the Olympic Games presents an opportunity to envision and build together the next chapter in Boston's history. The success of our bid for the Olympics depends on the support of residents and we should only move forward in a way that will bring the greatest benefit to the City and its neighborhoods. Over the next year, I encourage residents to engage in a conversation to learn more about what the Olympics could mean for Boston and the entire Commonwealth, and to put forward any suggestions or concerns. The Olympics offers a catalyst to unlocking our full potential and only through collaboration can we take advantage of this chance to elevate Boston to new heights. As a society, we will never turn our backs on people who are at the most vulnerable time in their life. Through this plan, we are focusing on the area of Melnea Cass/Mass Ave to make the needed improvements for those who are struggling: those with a substance use disorder, and the residents impacted by this epidemic throughout Boston's neighborhoods. There is not one perfect solution to dealing with this crisis, but we are committed to doing everything we can. Our primary focus will always b"
Q3518911," Well, I would tell the Republicans quit complaining and go out and earn these folks' right to vote for you. Go out and talk to them. I find it very -- and in fact, I think some of the language that has come out of the Republicans, I would tell them to be very careful at how they frame this, very careful of their rhetoric. They have an opportunity to go out and get these individual new voters to vote for them. But make your argument. These are the same legislators, George, that, just in this session, sent me a bill to sign that would have been very similar to North Carolina, religious freedom bill, that would have rolled back the rights and given protections to those who didn't discriminate against LGBT members. They sent me a bill that would have defunded parts of Planned Parenthood. This is the same group of individuals several years ago passed the transvaginal ultrasound against women. I told folks when I ran for governor, I will be a brick wall to protect your rights for women. I will protect the rights of LGBT members and I'll do everything I can to get disenfranchised voters entrenched. So I've done that. It's exactly what I talked about. Our economy is booming. I just announced a 4 percent unemployment, biggest budget surplus in Virginia history. We put $1 billion in education. It works when you welcome people back into society and make them feel good about themselves. The Senate Republican's latest effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act would have the exact same disastrous consequences for Virginia's families as the previous versions that they tried to ram through earlier this year. This legislation, like the earlier iterations, was not designed to make health care better. It is nothing more than a tax cut for the rich and a poorly disguised cost shift from the federal government to the states and families. Once again, middle-class families, seniors, and women suffer the most as premiums will skyrocket and Medicaid will be slashed. This bill re-introduces policies that gut protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions and no longer requires insurers to provide essential service coverage. And it goes further by slashing funding to states for marketplace tax credits and cost-sharing reductions on the way to zeroing them out completely after 2026. This backdoor effort to force through legislation without waiting for a CBO score or even holding as much as a single hearing is totally unacceptable. Our estimates is that this will be a $1.2 Billion cut to Virginia's Medicaid program. I urge the Senate Republicans to stop undermining our economy and health care system and instead to work together in a transparent and bipartisan manner to fix the existing issues with the ACA. I've continually raised this issue. Twice, I have brought legislation before the General Assembly. Twice, I've asked that we have background checks. Twice now, they have rejected background checks in the commonwealth, as you know, this year, out of the General Assembly, I had to veto a piece of legislation that allowed individuals to buy machine guns in the Commonwealth of Virginia. I had to veto another piece of legislation that allowed folks to carry loaded shotguns in their cars. Now that's a tragedy. We actually had an an incident, in the history in Virginia, where a state trooper came up on a scene, they were loading the car into the wrecker, and shotgun went off, and the state trooper was killed. So, I've had to veto -- those pieces of legislation actually passed our General Assembly. So, I'm trying to bring common sense ideas. As I say, I'm a gun owner, I'm a hunter. I go through background checks. It takes five minutes. Hand your license over, and run the data. There are individuals in this country who should not be allowed to own a firearm. And it's just to me common sense, and it's just tragic that this kind of legislation cannot be passed and signed into law. He created the mess, and actually he thought it was working for him. He doubled down yesterday. I think with the pictures coming out and the uproar all over the country, I think he realized once again, he had taken us down the low road. He has done this time and time again. I was hopeful after he got elected, that when he took the oath of office and I served as chairman of the National Governors Association, all the governors we thought he would rise to the occasion and be president, but he hasn't. He has continued to take the low road and what he has done in the situation with the children is appalling. Not only in America, but Chris, all over the world they are looking at the United States of America, the greatest nation on earth, the beacon of democracy and morality. What he has done is questioned people's thoughts on how they think about America. For the people who follow us and for people who do things we don't like around the world, they look to what America is doing now, and I'm afraid of what their behavior will be going forward. Virginia public safe"
Q13133," Michelle and I grieve with all the families in El Paso and Dayton who endured these latest mass shootings. Even if details are still emerging, there are a few things we already know to be true. First, no other nation on Earth comes close to experiencing the frequency of mass shootings that we see in the United States. No other developed nation tolerates the levels of gun violence that we do. Every time this happens, we're told that tougher gun laws won't stop all murders; that they won't stop every deranged individual from getting a weapon and shooting innocent people in public places. But the evidence shows that they can stop some killings. They can save some families from heartbreak. We are not helpless here. And until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening. Second, while the motivations behind these shootings may not yet be fully known, there are indications that the El Paso shooting follows a dangerous trend: troubled individuals who embrace racist ideologies and see themselves obligated to act violently to preserve white supremacy. Like the followers of ISIS and other foreign terrorist organizations, these individuals may act alone, but they've been radicalized by white nationalist websites that proliferate on the internet. That means that both law enforcement agencies and internet platforms need to come up with better strategies to reduce the influence of these hate groups. But just as important, all of us have to send a clarion call and behave with the values of tolerance and diversity that should be the hallmark of our democracy. We should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments; leaders who demonize those who don't look like us, or suggest that other people, including immigrants, threaten our way of life, or refer to other people as sub-human, or imply that America belongs to just one certain type of people. Such language isn't new -- it's been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history, here in America and around the world. It is at the root of slavery and Jim Crow, the Holocaust, the genocide in Rwanda and ethnic cleansing in the Balkans. It has no place in our politics and our public life. And it's time for the overwhelming majority of Americans of goodwill, of every race and faith and political party, to say as much -- clearly and unequivocally, Celebrating the holidays in the White House over these past eight years has been a true privilege. We've been able to welcome over half a million guests... our outstanding pastry chefs have baked 200,000 holiday cookies... and Barack has treated the American people to countless dad jokes. This year's White House holiday theme is `The Gift of the Holidays' , and our decorations reflect some of our greatest gifts as a nation: from our incredible military families, to the life-changing impact of a great education. The idea that we are our brother's keeper and our sister's keeper; that we should treat others as we would want to be treated. And that we care for the sick... feed the hungry... and welcome the stranger... no matter where they come from, or how they practice their faith. As always, many of our troops are far from home this time of year, and their families are serving and sacrificing right along with them. Their courage and dedication allow the rest of us to enjoy this season. That's why we've tried to serve them as well as they've served this country. Go to JoiningForces. gov to see how you can honor and support the service members, veterans and military families in your community -- not just during the holidays, but all year round. And we wish you and your family a happy and healthy 2017... thanks, and God bless, We must begin by acknowledging the hard truth: We will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes. There will be times when nations -- acting individually or in concert -- will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified. I make this statement mindful of what Martin Luther King Jr. said in this same ceremony years ago: Violence never brings permanent peace. It solves no social problem: it merely creates new and more complicated ones.' As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr. King's life work, I am living testimony to the moral force of non-violence. I know there's nothing weak -- nothing passive -- nothing naïve -- in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King. But as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation, I cannot be guided by their examples alone. I face the world as it is, and cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people. For make no mistake: Evil does exist in the world. A non-violent movement could not have halted Hitler's armies. Negotiations cannot convince al Qaeda's leaders to lay down their arms. To say that force may sometimes be necessary is not a c"
Q16885910," We are looking forward to our preparations for Tennessee and looking forward to a great game. It will be good to come back off of such a disappointing loss and play a rival. It will give us some extra juice this week to get out there and play a lot better than we did last week. Just like I said in the postgame, after the Mississippi State game, just really disappointed in all areas. I think we can definitely coach a heck of a lot better, we can play better. Again, there were some tough matchups and there were some critical moments in the game that once again changed the game. You never know what those plays are going to be. I felt like we were scratching and crawling and it was 14-10 and we had two stops and possessions to go up with the ball in scoring position and we let the game get out of hand and away from us at the end of the first half was critical. We have to do a better job and I have to do a better job of managing that situation. We have to make some plays to keep it close there at half and regroup at halftime and come back and finish the game. Even after all that and all that adversity and some poor play and poor coaching, we had an opportunity to cut it to a one-possession game with first and goal at the three and have a penalty there to push us back. There are lot of things and blame and it starts with me. We will get it corrected and move on. That is a very good football team with an exceptional quarterback and how anybody is not talking about that guy in the Heisman race, you need to have your head examined. He is a terrific ball player with a lot of poise and a lot of good weapons. Like I said going into the game, they do an excellent job and put a lot of stress on you and they beat us. They beat us and outcoached us and played better than we did. I think certainly it could have been closer than it was and those are the things we have to get fixed to put us in a better position to win. We are excited and I have no doubt we will get some things fixed and we will move on to Tennessee and be excited to play a big game here this Saturday night. Again, very disappointed, just like I said postgame. It was a disappointing loss. Obviously, it was very tough on our team and on our players. They really put their heart and soul into that game and put it all on the line. We all know it was very important, there was no denying that leading up to the game. That is the good that I take from it, is that the players really put a lot into it. They were not particularly happy with the way that we had been playing and went into that game and put a lot into it. We had a great week or preparation and really played very well at times in that game. Again, the game comes down to wins and losses in critical situations and there were plenty of those that I am sure we will get into. In a nutshell when you have the ball first and goal and get zero points from about six-seven inches away, that was the start of a night that was very frustrating for all of us. Not getting that ball in the endzone then the second opportunity when we got the ball on the two or the three yard line and again come away with nothing. It is very difficult. Defensively, we felt like the guys played probably as solid as we have played all year with the exception of maybe one other game. The guys played really well. We gave up 14 points and really weren't even on the field for the pick-6 touchdown and giving it to them on the two or the three (yard line) that is hard to overcome that. The game comes down to a few possessions and again the good that comes from it, I thought our players played as well as we had certainly in November since I have been here. To play that fast and play with that much energy and do those things. Their defense was very good as we know and the offense moved the ball quite well and really did some good things. The turnovers stalled us and then a couple of possessions inside the redzone stalled us. Defensively, we played an outstanding game really. We gave up one big play, really, the deception play. We got deceived and tricked and gave up that score. Outside of that the defense played really well. Looking forward to this week's game vs. Mississippi State. It will be another great challenge for us. To recap the Auburn game, much like I said in the postgame, I think we did some really good things and there are things that we need to get corrected. It is a game of inches and we were just a few plays off. We have to go back to work to find a way to make those plays, that is the difference in close games. Overall, I was pleased. We were very efficient offensively, did some very good things and moved the ball well. We hurt ourselves on a few drives, the interception early in particular set us back, but we were really moving the ball well. Defensively, we need to get off to a better start and part of it maybe was the tempo. We need to get lined up more efficiently with a better sense of urgency. When we did (get lined up better) w"
Q538868," From my first day in the Senate, I've fought against Obama's war on coal, his out-of-touch public policies, and will continue to defend West Virginia's way of life against any group, any politician, and any President. The DC lobbyists and out-of-state billionaires attacking me are trying to fool West Virginians about my record even though they know that no Senator has a longer and more successful record of taking on the EPA and standing up for coal than me. I am a part of the lawsuit opposing Obama's Clean Power Plan, standing with Attorney Generals and Governors from across the country. In fact, when I was your Governor, I sued the President and EPA myself. I have written bills that passed the Senate overturning the President's New Source Performance Standard -- a regulation meant to stop the construction of any new coal-fired power plant. And I joined Senator Capito on a separate resolution to overturn the Clean Power Plan itself. As for the Supreme Court vacancy, only outsiders, billionaires, and DC lobbyists would think it's right to refuse to do our basic job as Senators and meet with a Supreme Court nominee. That kind of partisan gridlock is exactly what's wrong with Washington. I was raised with West Virginia values, and West Virginia decency demands that you look someone in the eye and hear them out -- particularly if you're going to vote against them. I personally have real concerns about Judge Garland's record, and I'd like the chance to hear every member of the Senate question him on the issues that matter to West Virginia, like our 2nd amendment rights and his position on the Clean Power Plan. But in case anyone doubts my position, let me be very clear; especially to those outsiders who never grew up in West Virginia. If Judge Garland's answers are vague, if he doesn't make clear he will uphold the Constitution and act in West Virginia's best interest, then I will vote against him -- irrespective of what Democrats, the President, or anyone in Washington wants. That is the West Virginia way, and that is what I will honor. Our President and his Administration think our country can do without coal, and they are dead wrong. They are in denial. They deny the cold-hard fact that coal continues to generate almost 40 percent of the electricity in America, and it will play an essential role in our energy portfolio for the next thirty years. The EPA has flat out ignored the Department of Energy's data that says coal will still produce more than 30 percent of our electricity through 2040. It is completely contradictory that the EPA continues to impose unreasonable and unattainable rules in an attempt to regulate coal into extinction. The people who suffer are our hard-working West Virginians and consumers across the country. This Administration's demonization of coal has already devastated the coal mining industry in West Virginia and in energy-producing states across the country. Because of unattainable and unreasonable regulations, thousands of coal miners have been laid off in West Virginia alone, and more than 26 coal companies have filed for bankruptcy. The bottom line is this Administration has been utterly unrealistic when it comes to the role of coal in our energy future. Never before has the federal government forced an industry to do something that is technologically infeasible. By requiring the adoption of costly carbon capture and storage technologies that have not yet been proven commercially viable, the EPA is essentially setting a standard that is impossible to meet. Instead of working with energy-producing states like West Virginia to develop cleaner technology and partnering with the private sector to grow our energy economy, this Administration is picking winners and losers when it comes to our nation's energy policy. I will continue to explore all available options to prevent these unattainable regulations from further crippling our energy production, jeopardizing our energy grid, and putting our workers out of good-paying jobs. Late tonight, I voted on the fourth short-term continuing resolution for FY2018 in order to keep the government open. While I voted for this continuing resolution because I refuse to support a government shutdown, it doesn't mean I believe this should be the way we govern. We are already more than 3 months into FY2018 and we still don't have a budget to fund our government for the rest of the fiscal year. Every time we pass another short-term funding bill, we put our national security at risk, we stall critical projects and throw our economy and our citizens into limbo. We have important work to do including ensuring our military is equipped to protect our country, fighting the opioid epidemic, keeping our promise to coal miners so they don't lose their hard-earned pensions, fully funding the Children's Health Insurance Program and Community Health Centers, expanding broadband access and passing a comprehensive infrastructure package. Funding the government is o"
Q1077115," In an interview on MPR News today, Coleman spoke publicly about that shooting for the first time. The mayor said it appears to have been justified. `At this point I've seen no evidence to suggest those aren't exactly the facts - this is an officer-involved shooting that was absolutely a part of procedure and protocol.' Coleman said the other 10 shootings were justified as well. He argues the data are misleading, because the numbers are so small; they don't mean St. Paul's officers are trigger-happy.' I mean that's like saying, `Well, you had one murder last year, and two murders this year, so your crime rate has doubled,' he said. `That's not statistically significant. It doesn't mean that we shouldn't ask the tough questions. But I'd ask people to look at the facts and circumstances, because in almost every instance there was a direct threat of violence, if in fact that hadn't already been an act of violence. ' But Baleo and most of the players I've ever worked with are nice guys. Baleo, especially with that kind of attention, you could forgive him for changing a little bit. But honestly? For the four or five years I've been with him he hasn't. He has matured a bit more as he has got older but he has always been the same person really -- very quiet and it doesn't float his boat all the attention he gets. He's very much for his wife and his children, his family in Cardiff -- his mum and his dad. That is his universe. The football think that's his live and it comes natural to him. It's not something he is using to facilitate a superstar lifestyle. He just genuinely loves being on pitch. the economics of the American theater encouraged producers and writers to narrow their scope, use smaller casts, write smaller, do plays that take place in one room. I think that is unfortunate. Some of the most exciting plays want to be told expansively, with a lot of characters and locations and big costumes. One of the things this company excelled at, and should continue to excel at, is that it has the resources and facilities to pull that off. I don't mean just Shakespeare, but how do we mine the stories that come out of this region, and say to writers, `Think expansively. Think big. Let's see what comes out of that' ? St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman is talking up the city's paid leave policy at the White House Friday-an idea generating popularity nationally and touted by President Barack Obama in this week's State of the Union address. St. Paul started giving opportunities for its 2,700 employees to take paid paternity as of Jan. 1. Non-birth parents get two weeks and birth parents get four weeks. St. Paul was among the first cities nationally to adopt the plan. The policy will cost the city about $200,000 annually, though Coleman says he expects to make that back in retaining talented staffers amid the state's booming economy. I come from one situation as an international manager where your complaints are that you don't have enough control, it's not day-to-day, you don't have the same squad to work with, and I've come back into the domestic side where it's day-to-day and there is no escape. Even if you want an escape you can't because there's another game to prepare for. I was doing probably 12 Press conferences a year. It feels like I've done 12 in a day here because of the nature of the Press conferences. You've got to ask the questions because the club's not winning and it's in a certain place and I've got to answer them. I'm extremely excited for audiences to experience the music, costumes, and the cast in this production. I've invited multi-instrumentalist and composer Tom Hagerman from the internationally-known Denver band DeVotchKa to compose the music. Audiences who have seen the collaboration with DeVotchKa previously in Sweeney Todd can expect to hear something just as unique, and a beautiful blending of the music with the story of Twelfth Night. This production will also include costume designs by Kevin Copenhaver, and audiences can expect the costumes to be Renaissance with a Mediterranean twist. The Sentinel platform is a leading example of a financial services company building an elegant solution to meet its unique needs and developing it into an industry-leading technology. As we worked with Goldman Sachs in discussing threats and intelligence-powered security operations, it quickly became apparent that acquiring Sentinel was a natural way to meaningfully advance the state of technology and help protect the wider financial services industry as well as other sectors facing greater cyber risk stakes. LookingGlass is proud to shepherd the platform into its next stages. They'll make it difficult for us again, but why should they make it easy? We'll just concentrate on what we want to do. It's notoriously tough when we come here and it's not as if Cyprus have got nothing to play for. It's a must-win game for them if they're going to do anything in this campaign, but they'll be need to be prepared for us because "
Q888132," When President Obama or some of my colleagues call for the lifting of the embargo, they are asking Congress to unilaterally discard these conditions. So, I ask them, which of these conditions -- codified in U.S. law -- do they disagree with or oppose that they are willing to unilaterally discard them? Is it, for example -- the condition that Cuba `legalizes all political activity?' The condition that Cuba `releases all political prisoners and allows for investigations of Cuban prisons by appropriate international human rights organizations?' The condition that Cuba `dissolves the present Department of State Security in the Cuban Ministry of the Interior, including the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution and the Rapid Response Brigades?' The condition that Cuba `makes a public commitment to organizing free and fair elections for a new government?' The condition that Cuba `makes public commitments to and is making demonstrable progress in establishing an independent judiciary; respecting internationally recognized human rights and basic freedoms as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Cuba is a signatory nation; allows the establishment of independent trade unions as set forth in conventions 87 and 98 of the International Labor Organization, and allows the establishment of independent social, economic, and political associations?' The condition that Cuba give `adequate assurances that it will allow the speedy and efficient distribution of assistance to the Cuban people?' The condition that Cuba is `effectively guaranteeing the rights of free speech and freedom of the press, including granting permits to privately owned media and telecommunications companies to operate in Cuba?' The condition that Cuba is `assuring the right to private property?' The condition that Cuba is `taking appropriate steps to return to United States citizens -- and entities which are 50 percent or more beneficially owned by United States citizens -- property taken by the Cuban Government from such citizens and entities on or after January 1, 1959, or to provide equitable compensation to such citizens and entities for such property?' The condition that Cuba has `extradited or otherwise rendered to the United States all persons sought by the United States Department of Justice for crimes committed in the United States?' Which is it? Which conditions do they disagree with? Whether or not the supporters of the agreement admit it, this deal is based on hope. Hope that when the nuclear sunset clause expires, Iran will have succumbed to the benefits of commerce and global integration. Hope that the hardliners will have lost their power and the revolution will end its hegemonic goals. Hope that the regime will allow the Iranian people to decide their fate. And hope is part of human nature, but unfortunately it is not a national security strategy. The Iranian regime, led by the Ayatollah, wants, above all, to preserve the regime and its Revolution, unlike the Green Revolution of 2009. So it stretches incredulity to believe they signed on to a deal that would in any way weaken the regime, or threaten the goals of the Revolution. Now, I understand that this deal represents a trade-off, a hope that things may be different in Iran in ten to fifteen years. Maybe Iran will desist from its nuclear ambitions. Maybe they'll stop exporting and supporting terrorism. Maybe they'll stop holding innocent Americans hostage. Maybe they'll stop burning American flags. And maybe their leadership will stop chanting, `Death to America' in the streets of Tehran. Or maybe they won't. I know that, in many respects, it would be far easier to support this deal, as it would have been to vote for the war in Iraq at the time. But I didn't choose the easier path then, and I am not going to now. President Trump promised to do right by our nation's DREAMers, but with this decision he has chosen once again to cloak his presidency with a white nationalist flag instead of the diverse fabric of our multicultural American society. By ending DACA, the Trump Administration is making a mistake of historic proportions for which our nation will pay dearly both in economic and moral capital. DREAMers are the motherhood and apple pie of the immigrant community and they're a critical part of the solution to our many challenges as a country. Declaring open season on these model citizens -- as General Kelly likes to call them -- is cruel, inhumane and simply un-American. The fact is today's announcement makes the passage of a clean DREAM Act a national emergency.... I personally worked for years to convince the Obama administration to create the DACA program and I refuse to let its beneficiaries be further victimized in the name of nativist fear mongering. Now is not the time to sit idly by hoping extremists catch up with reality; it is time for elected leaders to do our job, stand up and protect those who cannot protect themselves. Well, look, divers"
Q7287916," Since the federal court's June 26th finding that 11 Virginia House of Delegates districts were unconstitutional, I have closely monitored the legislature's progress to produce a remedy. I understand and appreciate the effort devoted to the maps drafted in House Bills 7001, 7002, and 7003; however, the nature of the August 30th and September 27th proceedings in the House Privileges and Elections Committee reinforced my belief that this partisan process should not continue and that the federal court is best positioned to construct a remedial districting plan. Given this conviction, I must unequivocally state that I will veto House Bill 7003 should it reach my desk. The federal court has contemplated a process by which it, through a nonpartisan special master, will construct a remedial districting plan should legislative efforts fail, and I believe that is the best course of action before us. Virginians deserve fair and constitutional lines in place in time for June 2019 primaries, without further delay. I have championed nonpartisan redistricting from my first campaign for public office in 2007 and I continue to believe that is the true solution on this incredibly important issue. In the 2018 General Assembly session I offered amendments to House Bill 1598 and Senate Bill 106 that would have created a fairer redistricting process, particularly with respect to the protection of racial minorities, but those were defeated on a party-line vote. I hope legislators from both parties and in both chambers will come to the table in the 2019 session to propose and adopt an amendment to enshrine nonpartisan redistricting in the Virginia Constitution. I will support this effort and engage when appropriate to reinforce the fundamentals of fairness, which are lacking in the current process. Furthermore, I will continue to advocate for the protection of minority representation in the General Assembly. I applaud the NCAA for standing by its commitment to fairness and inclusion by deciding to relocate seven championships out of North Carolina for this academic year. As I have stated previously, North Carolina's House Bill 2 is one of the most anti-LGBT laws in the country. Backlash over this bill has resulted in over 180 national employers calling on Governor McCrory to repeal the bill, and expansions from companies like PayPal and Deutsche Bank have been cancelled. The NCAA's decision follows that of the National Basketball Association, which has moved the NBA All-Star game out of North Carolina for 2017. I urge the NCAA to consider Virginia when deciding where to relocate these championships. Governor McAuliffe has followed the precedents of Governors Warner and Kaine in signing an executive order that bans employment discrimination against the LGBT community in state government. This administration is working every day to make sure that Virginia is open and inclusive. Our `open for business' approach, high quality of life, and world-class colleges and universities make Virginia an ideal destination for NCAA championships. We have gladly hosted NCAA championship events across the Commonwealth, and we would be honored to host more student athletes here in Virginia. Today's motion to proceed with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act over the loud protests of millions of Americans is a shameless prioritization of politics over people that many will pay for with their lives. As a doctor, I am disturbed by this move that could strip healthcare from over 520,000 Virginians who rely on the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid for their access to quality, affordable healthcare. The senators who have today voted to pursue this reckless action through a secretive process that didn't provide the American people the proper transparency even though their lives depend on it. through a secretive process that didn't provide the American people even though their lives depend on it. Just this weekend, I joined other providers in volunteering my medical services to Virginians who are underserved and underinsured and who would encourage our legislators to put party aside to find them solutions. This process, done in the shadows and under the cover of uncertainty, does them the ultimate disservice. We are once again dooming people to being one medical emergency away from financial demise -- this is is unacceptable in the richest country in the world. As governor, I will keep fighting for access to quality, affordable healthcare for Virginians. Virginia benefits from the important work of securing our border and we have a responsibility to contribute to that mission. However, we also have a responsibility to stand up to policies or actions that run afoul of the values that define us as Americans. Today I spoke with the Adjutant General of the Virginia National Guard and ordered him to withdraw four soldiers and one helicopter from Arizona until the federal government ends its enforcement of a zero-tolerance policy that separates children from thei"

Although initially a long shot, the proposal quickly gained steam amid news of huge data breaches and privacy leaks. Associated Press By RACHEL LERMAN Updated 12/29/2019 10:28 AM SAN FRANCISCO -- Forty million Californians will soon have sweeping digital-privacy rights stronger than any seen before in the U.S., posing a significant challenge to Big Tech and the data economy it helped create. So long as state residents don't mind shouldering much of the burden of exercising those rights, that is. Come Wednesday, roughly one in 10 Americans will gain the power to review their personal information collected by large companies around the world, from purchase histories and location tracking to compiled'  profiles'  that slot people into categories such as religion, ethnicity and sexual orientation. Starting January 1, they can also force these companies - including banks, retailers and, of course, tech companies - to stop selling that information or even to delete it in bulk. The law defines data sales so broadly that it covers almost any information sharing that provides a benefit to business, including data transfers between corporate affiliates and with third party'  data brokers'  - middlemen who trade in personal information. And because it applies to any company that meets a threshold for interacting with state residents, the California law might end up serving as a de facto national standard. Early signs of compliance have already started cropping up in the form of'  Don't sell my personal information'  links at the bottom of many corporate websites.'  If we do this right in California, Plains is pleased that (i) our employee was dismissed before trial began; (ii) 37 of the initial 46 charges against the company were either dismissed by the Judge or resulted in acquittals or deadlocks by the jury; and (iii) in particular, that the jury did not find any knowing misconduct by Plains with respect to the operation of Line 901. Of the nine counts of conviction, eight were misdemeanors, consisting of one count relating to a 25 minute delayed reporting and seven counts under California's strict liability misdemeanor statutes (six animal takings counts and one discharge count). Plains' operations with respect to Line 901 met and/or exceeded applicable legal and industry standards, and accordingly, we believe that the jury erred in its verdict on one count where applicable California laws allowed a conviction under a negligence standard. We intend to fully evaluate and consider all of our legal options with respect to the trial and resulting jury decision announced today. Plains continues to accept full responsibility for the impact of the accident. We are committed to doing the right thing. The verdict reflected no knowing wrongdoing by Plains or our employees with respect to the operation of Line 901, and the testimony established our comprehensive cleanup effort. Numerous witnesses testified that Plains did everything possible to return areas impacted by the 2015 oil release to conditions as good as or better than before the release. Previously, charges were dropped against a Plains employee and two-thirds of the original charges have been dismissed. On behalf of the nearly 40 million people of California, I stand shoulder-to-shoulder with attorneys general in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont, and the District of Columbia, in filing an amicus brief in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to preserve the suspension of the Trump Administration's travel ban. The Administration's reckless dismissal of the Constitution threatens to rip apart California families, risks their economic well-being and defies centuries of our American tradition. The brief I joined tells the appeals court that immigrants are the life-blood of our nation who work hard to build our country, especially in California.

Q7793121," I mean, this was dog-whistle politics. The whole -- Jake, your question's about immigration. This question's about socialism, dog-whistle politics. I just find it amazing that we -- I was there for, I think it was an hour and 20 minutes. It felt like five hours. José Andrés was next to me, the chef, and he, during the immigration point, again, we all were just apoplectic, but respectful. And what we see here, once again, is the effort to divide. We should be talking about how we're going to come together around health care. We should be talking about -- he talked about a [ n ] `economic miracle,' talk to the people who are working two and three jobs, struggling to make ends meet. They haven't gotten a real raise in years because real wage growth has been stagnant. People are working harder and falling behind. And so, he uses dog-whistle politics, socialism. He uses immigration, and the border talk, the caravans are coming, to distract us from the culture of corruption that is there. And then he -- in a Nixonian way, says no investigations. That's the Donald Trump that we saw in the campaign, that's the Donald Trump we've seen for two years, and frankly, that's a preview of his closing argument in 2020. Today, I am pleased to announce that the parties have reached an agreement in principle on a four-year contract, resolving the open issues in the ongoing labor dispute between Verizon's workers, unions, and management. The parties are now working to reduce the agreement to writing, after which the proposal will be submitted to CWA and IBEW union members for ratification. Throughout the past 13 days of negotiations at the Department of Labor, I have observed firsthand the parties' good faith commitment to narrowing differences and forging an agreement that helps workers and the company. The parties have a shared interest in the success of Verizon and its dedicated workforce. Indeed, these two interests are inextricably intertwined. This tentative resolution is a testament to the power of collective bargaining. I commend the leadership of Verizon, CWA, and IBEW for their commitment to resolving these difficult issues in the spirit of constructive engagement. I expect that workers will be back on the job next week. What happened last night should never happen again. We have staff working around the clock to assist the Iowa Democratic Party to ensure that all votes are counted. It is clear that the app in question did not function adequately. It will not be used in Nevada or anywhere else during the primary election process. The technology vendor must provide absolute transparent accounting of what went wrong. Our immediate goal is to ensure that every vote is counted as quickly as possible. Accuracy is our guidepost. As frustrating as the last 24 hours have been, let us not lose sight of our ultimate goal: To defeat Donald Trump, to take back our democracy, and to improve the lives of millions by electing Democrats up and down the ballot. consulted with CNMI government officials and other stakeholders, to obtain information related to training, education, and other assistance provided to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. The Government of the CNMI shared with the Department the good-faith efforts it has made and its continuing efforts to locate, educate, and train U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to assume jobs in the CNMI. They reported that they continue to provide education and training to unemployed or underemployed U.S. workers to help them become sufficiently qualified to replace foreign workers. They developed high school career technical education... curriculum that is responsive to the needs of employers in the CNMI. We invested unprecedented amounts of money in the midterm elections so we could win... We did some wholesale adjustments to our rules for selecting the next nominee. The purpose of that is so we could win by earning the trust of voters. We just announced the week or so ago a very aggressive organizing initiative so that we could give an army or organizers to our next nominee. That's about helping us win. We've overhauled our data so that candidates running for office will have access to state-of-the-art data. They will have so much more knowledge of the voters, which enables us to have a much better chance of winning... That's what it's about -- winning so that we can take back our democracy. What Republicans have to do is understand is that we need a budget that reflects our values. When you try to cut Meals on Wheels, when you cut investments in education, when you propose to cut the budget of the National Institute of Health by billion dollars, you are cutting that lifeline of research investment that saves lives. Right now what we are seeing plain and simply is that the Republicans are overreaching. That is why we are going to win seats like the congressional seat in District 6 down in Georgia. That is why we are competitive and on the verge of upsets elsewhere."
Q22260," I have been thorough in examining Judge Kavanaugh's record. And while the recent allegations against him are troubling and deserve a thorough and fair examination by the Senate Judiciary Committee, my decision is not based on those allegations but rather on his positions on several key issues, most importantly the avalanche of dark, anonymous money that is crushing our democracy. He has revealed his bias against limits on campaign donations which places him completely out of the mainstream of this nation. He wrote, `And I have heard very few people say that limits on contributions to candidates are unconstitutional although I for one tend to think those limits have some constitutional problems.' Going even further, Judge Kavanaugh will give free reign to anonymous donors and foreign governments through their citizens to spend money to interfere and influence our elections with so-called `issue ads.' These `issue ads' are now flooding the airways in this nation to directly influence election outcomes, drowning the concept of individuals having the strongest voice in our democracy. Judge Kavanaugh has clearly said that there should be literally no restrictions on these ads. He has called restrictions on these dark money issue ads `blatantly unconstitutional.' 2 And in a court opinion, he went out of his way to say that foreign nationals weren't restricted from creating or contributing to these ads -- even when that wasn't the issue before the court.3 A Russian company that has been indicted for election interference is currently using Judge Kavanaugh's opinion to argue for their innocence. While I am also uncomfortable about his view on Presidential power as it relates to the rule of law, and his position that corporations are people, it is his allegiance to the position that unlimited donations and dark anonymous money, from even foreign interests, should be allowed to swamp the voices of individuals that has been the determining factor in my decision to vote no on his nomination. She's been steadfast in her ability to operate independently.' When lawmakers nearly failed to fund the Department of Homeland Security in February over a dispute about President Obama's executive actions on immigration, Collins introduced a bill that separated immigration from the rest of the spending measure. Her legislation augmented a broader deal that prevented a partial department shutdown. Her negotiating skills also helped break a Senate logjam this month over abortion language in a bipartisan bill to combat sex-trafficking. Collins and Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, proposed a method to pull the abortion reference out of the bill. The move helped propel the negotiations that led to the bill's unanimous passage last month and broke a GOP blockade of the nomination for attorney general. In a Senate where the loudest GOP voices frequently get the most attention-Senator Ted Cruz of Texas as Exhibit A-Democrats lavish praise on Collins as someone with whom they can work. her ability to operate independently, Well I'm going to treat this nomination like I have all of the nominations which means I'm going to look at his record, I'm going to make an evaluation over all of his writings in his speeches, obviously I've had the opportunity to visit with him. I have voted for almost eighty percent of President Trump's nominees so I am obviously willing to vote for one of President Trump's nominees, I voted for many of his cabinet members, but I make each decision on individual basis and so it is obviously too early for me to make a determination as to whether or not he... I'm going to be looking to see if he's going to take the side of corporations or the little guy. I'm going to be looking to see if he'll protect the protections we have against discrimination against people that have been skipped over in the Affordable Care Act. I'm going to be looking at how he is treated First Amendment claims I'm very much supportive of the First Amendment so those are some of the things I'm going to take a look at. Well, it's very clear to me that Donald Trump is unfit and, frankly, I think he's dangerous. I believe there's a chance he violated the law with what he said, inviting a cyber-attack of Russia, a dictator what has violated all of our principles of liberty and freedom in Russia. The notion that he would invite a foreign nation to conduct an attack against our country it's beyond the pale and I believe it violates the Logan Act and he should be investigated for that. I don't think it was a joke at all. And it certainly wasn't a joke when he said he'd pull the plug on NATO if he were president. And, by the way, that had Putin dancing in the halls. Putin is excited about Donald Trump being president of the United States. That notion make it very happy because he knows he could roll through Ukraine and other countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union because that's his goal is to take back that territory and he kno"
Q430518," Well that's one of the thorniest issues that I've had since right when I first ran for Governor in 2010, right through until today. Because I can see clearly, both sides of the argument. Some people who, I think like yourself, have moved more recently a little further away from the urban cores, as that happens more, and more, and more frequently, more and more property owners, people that in some cases have for generations owned mineral rights, in many cases part of their retirement plans, they become somehow imperiled. And that's the trick. Public safety's always gon na be our priority. We're gon na do everything we can to make sure that operators recover and extract natural resources as efficiently and safely as humanly possible. We're lucky in Colorado because we do have some of the more responsible natural resource extraction companies, and they are looking at using electric rigs, which are much quieter. They're looking at not working at night. They're close enough to where it would make a difference. I think that obviously we want to get to universal coverage, and I'm proud that while I was governor, we reduced the number of uninsured by almost two-thirds. We got to almost 95 percent coverage. And beyond that, people are alarmed and threatened by price-gouging in their health-care costs. One of the first things I would do as a senator is support legislation to allow our government to negotiate bulk discounts for prescription drugs and medication. We're the only industrialized country not able to do that. So we need to negotiate with those companies. They're going to have to raise their rates a little for the rest of the world, but that shouldn't be that big of a deal. And in the same way, I think we need to push hospitals and clinics toward transparency, so if people are going in for stitches in their arm or a tonsillectomy, they can see how much it's going to cost, what the co-pay is going to be, and what the cost is going to be at a neighboring clinic or health-care facility. It's Election Day, I get it. But you know, when I started, I was for the death penalty. But when you get the facts, right, you see how much it costs, over $15 million per case, when you see how it prolongs the suffering and the agony of the families of victims, when you see that it's no deterrent, right. It doesn't matter which state got rid of the death penalty like 50 years ago, they don't have any more murders, no more mass murders, no more grisly murders, it doesn't deter any more homicides. And then lastly the death penalty is dependent upon who the district attorney is. So, you commit the same crime in two different places and one you get the death penalty, one you don't. And the death penalty is final. It should be the absolute closest to justice you can get and it's actually the farthest away. He can say whatever he wants, let's get out the pitchforks and go to it but I think he was just making politics. This will clean our air and lower costs for consumers and lead to greater investments that support 21st century careers. What is it the critics don't like? Is it the cleaner air or the lower utility bills? Clean air matters. Xcel is also working with Evraz Rocky Mountain Steel, one of the cleanest steel plants in the world, to move toward renewable energy while protecting Pueblo's future as a center for steel manufacturing. We need everyone's support to make this a reality. Pueblo is known as Steel City, but soon it could also be `Solar and Wind City.' Most of us agree that science shows climate change is happening at a significant rate in large part because of humans. But even those of us who disagree on climate change can agree that we need to protect the Colorado environment our grandchildren will grow to love. With a strong economy where they can find jobs. The pull, nationwide, over 90-percent approval. In Colorado, we had a battle... not a single Republican legislator to support universal background checks in 2013 after that shooting. In the end we checked our local statistics, and we were getting to 50-percent of the gun purchases, about half, and we wanted to get to universal. We've had over 3,000 people, per year, apply for a background check, and had been a felon... felony conviction of a violent crime... and tried to buy a gun, and we stopped them. You have to assume there was an equal number that tried to buy a gun, and did buy a gun. I think we go to a few states separately... purple states, and maybe some red states... and give them their local statistics and then get Washington to do what it's supposed to do. How can we get it done in Colorado, and no one is able to get in done in Washington? The first thing we've got to address is the humanitarian crisis at the border and resolve these issues that most Americans are ashamed and embarrassed about -- taking children from the arms of their mothers and putting them in cages. And we've also got to restore funding to the Northern Triangle countries [ El Salvad"
Q461727," Well you can -- you can take a look at higher education and you can see, for example, with UCLA in California. It has been years since we've had the kind of representation of blacks coming into that institution that would make good sense for a state like California where, you know, black kids are graduating with 3.5, 3.9, 4. -- but they couldn't get into UCLA and that has happened all over the country. But let me tell you one of the reasons we have not been able to really fight for affirmative action. To me black people were ashamed of affirmative action and they would say to you, `Well no, I got in on my own. I am not a benefit -- I didn't benefit from affirmative action. I was smart enough.' Well come on people, you know? The fact of the matter is that you all of these legacy appointments of people who have relatives, who have management in these universities, and they get in because their parents gave money, because their parents are part of the alumni, et cetera. So that's real affirmative action for white people that happens in these universities. And so black people should not be ashamed -- (Applause) -- of affirmative action that is trying to correct the wrongs of the past. And so it has been very [ harmful ] in all of our universities. He was fumbling because he was trying to come up with a reasonable explanation, and it just did not work. The president suggested, told him whatever you want to call it to stay at his place, and he did it. And this is all about the president using his presidency to make money, to have the taxpayers paying for anything, anybody he can get living at his hotels, his golf properties. And we've seen that. I asked my staff to go back and take a look at what this president has done in terms of encouraging people to use his properties or himself using his properties as he goes on his golf trips. First of all, what we discovered was when we took a look was that Donald Trump, of course, again canceled his planned state visit to Poland, allegedly to deal with Hurricane Dorian. Instead, he went golfing. According to NBC's tracking data, Trump has spent a little under 1/3 of the days of his presidency visiting his own properties. Take a look at this. Nine hundred fifty-six days in office, 295 visits to Trump properties, including 99 days at Mar-a-Lago, 22 days at Trump International hotel, 13 days at Trump Towers and 227 days at Trump golf property, including 90 days at Trump National Bedminster -- that's in New Jersey, on and on and on. Trump's first action, a memorandum to the Department of Labor, seeks to delay crucial rules that require that financial advice be in customer's best interest. Why doesn't the President explain to the people of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin how delaying and repealing rules that protect seniors' hard-earned savings from unscrupulous financial advisers is a good thing? In the past our nation's workers and retirees have been swindled out of $17 billion in retirement savings each year because of conflicted financial advice from advisers seeking to fatten their own bottom line through excessive fees, high commissions, and kickback schemes. So, the Department of Labor stepped in and, after six years of careful consideration, finalized rules last year to require advisers to put the interests of their clients ahead of their own. Trump's actions today delay those rules so that his cronies in the Administration and on Wall Street can ultimately repeal them. A repeal of these common sense rules will only benefit powerful lobbyists representing insurance companies, big business, brokers and banks, not the millions of working families across the country who would be left vulnerable to their predatory practices. I am honored to have been selected by my colleagues to be the first Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee in the 116th Congress. Since 1995, I have served as Ranking Member or Chairwoman of every Subcommittee under the Committee's jurisdiction, taking on important issues on behalf of consumers, investors, and vulnerable populations. As Chairwoman, I will continue to prioritize protecting consumers and investors from abusive financial practices, making sure there are strong safeguards in place to prevent another financial crisis, expanding and supporting affordable housing opportunities, tackling the homelessness crisis, encouraging responsible innovation in financial technology, promoting diversity and inclusion in the financial services sector, conducting appropriate oversight and ensuring that hardworking Americans and small businesses have fair access to the financial system and opportunities to thrive. I consider it a privilege to hold the Chairwoman's gavel and look forward to working with my fellow Democrats, Ranking Member McHenry and my colleagues across the aisle on commonsense solutions that benefit hardworking Americans and strengthen our economy. Today, Google announced an initiative to protect consumers from pre"
Q970720," Well, look, I'm always for speaking to our adversaries, opening up diplomatic conversations. The problem is that this president seems bent on approaching this very erratically, very haphazardly. As you know, Brianna, he did this at the last minute and the problem is to be effective, this usually goes the other way around. There is a lot of staff work that goes into preparing a meeting like this so that concrete terms are on the table and you could get something out of the meeting. They had the first summit, the Singapore summit, just over a year ago, and North Korea has not abided by what it promised at that summit which was to produce an inventory of their weapons stockpile so there could be a baseline for further talks. So I'm not quite sure why this president is so bent on elevating the profile of a dictator like Kim Jong-un when Kim Jong-un has not lived up to his promise from the first summit. It is been a failure so far. We could always -- and I will be hopeful that there is some progress that comes out of this. If I take office on January 20, 2021, that I will come into office with a strong belief that climate change is a national emergency, that the fact that so many people in this country die because of gun violence, that is a national emergency, the folks that -- the fact that so many folks still sleep on the streets in our country because they can't find a place to live that is affordable is a national emergency. So I think this president is setting a bad precedent. What he should do is negotiate with Congress if he's determined to get funding for the wall. He hasn't been able to do that. And this is a symptom of his failure because I do believe that it is going to set a bad precedent and there are more pressing things that we need to do if we're considering what is a national emergency. I hope that it doesn't go in that direction, frankly, because I think that Congress should play its role, whether authorizing the use of military force or budgetary decisions. That is not something the president should abuse. The problem is that when you get administrations like the Trump Administration, you can't rely on the government to make a claim. I want to vest that power back in the people so that when we can show a disparate impact of certain practices of companies, of polluters that everyday Americans are able to file suit to try and get some sort of recourse. I also believe that we need to invest in these communities and their ability to withstand storms and other natural disasters and their ability to have something as simple as clean water or breathe clean air. When I was Secretary of Housing, one of the things that I found out was that 70 percent of HUD-funded public housing or subsidized housing was within a mile of a superfund site. Think about that. That's the environmental injustice and racism that we're dealing with and my plan would equip Americans with the tools to fight back and also make investments so that we can bring justice to right now what is a tremendous injustice. (applause) I would go back to treating these violations, somebody that's coming across the border, as a civil penalty, not a criminal one. I would not treat people who are seeking asylum as criminals. I would allow them to make their asylum claim. That would help reduce the backlog that has happened because we've been treating this as a crime. I would also be much more active in terms of investing in our judiciary system, so that those asylum claims can be processed. And instead of spending money on useless things like a wall... I would actually spend it on things like the family monitoring program that was developed in the Obama administration, so that when somebody goes -- comes over across the border, and they go through the legal process, they're allowed to be in the country, but they're actually monitored more carefully in a community-based way, and this program actually had a 99% success rate of people checking back in and making their court appearances. I absolutely think it's important for us to call it out for what it is, which is racism. You know I'm not somebody-like a lot of Americans I'm not somebody that likes to use that term, or that is quick to call somebody a racist. I think you have to be very careful before you use that word. However, this president has shown us time and time again from the way that he started his campaign, to the comments about that Mexican-American judge during the campaign, to his failure to immediately condemn white supremacists in Charlottesville in 2018, to just a couple of weeks ago his comments about Representative Ocasio-Cortez and her three colleagues, to just these comments about Representative Cummings and his district as well as his comments about a year and a half ago-or maybe two years ago now about John Lewis in his district. There is a pattern here. Yes, it would. I don't believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice. (Cheering and Applause) A"
Q923242," I thank Chair Capito for addressing a number of my priorities in this bill, in particular, the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund and the Small Business Administration. I commend her for addressing many agencies' pressing needs by providing resources above the level the President requested, including for the Internal Revenue Service, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and the Truman Scholarship Foundation. However, I am disappointed that the Senate bill includes two new riders that I don't believe belong in this bill. First, the bill includes a provision that effectively negates the campaign finance spending limits imposed on coordinated spending by federal candidates and party committees. Second, the bill puts in jeopardy continued funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If the subcommittee had marked-up, I would have offered amendments to provide much-needed funding to states to protect their election systems from outside intrusions and to protect the personal data collected by the new Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. I am also disappointed that funding for some key regulatory agencies falls far below the necessary levels, jeopardizing the ability of these agencies to vigorously protect markets, investors, and consumers from unscrupulous practices. In addition, I'm concerned that no funding is provided for construction of federal buildings. I look forward to working with the Chair and our House counterparts as the appropriations process advances. Well, he held up impressively under 11 hours of questioning. He's certainly a charming, engaging, intelligent, and skilled judge. In his decade on the 10th Circuit, he's participated in 2,700 decisions. I focused my questions yesterday on two different areas: Hobby Lobby, which was a groundbreaking case that for the first time recognized the idea -- what I think is the unprecedented concept -- that large for-profit corporations can have religious Free Exercise rights, and that those religious Free Exercise rights overrule the privacy interests, the autonomy interests of thousands of employees, and barred their access to contraceptive choices. I was hoping to better understand how he came to these conclusions and whether he appreciated how unprecedented that decision was, and whether he was able to articulate and defend how he reached those decisions. I also asked about a lengthy book that he wrote on assisted suicide just over 10 years ago, where he emphasized the inviolability of human life. Both of these I think are pretty important principles that he has reached out and made precedent-shattering or precedent-setting decisions, or indicated an intention to, and that he's taken certain stances when he worked for the Bush Justice Department and in that book about assisted suicide that I think are pretty strong indicators of what I think many of his core values may be. [ O ] n Thursday, we'll be voting to decide whether we are ready to finish debating the confirmation of Judge Gorsuch. I am not ready to end debate on this issue. So, I will be voting against closure unless we are able, as a body, to finally sit down and find a way to avoid the nuclear option, and ensure the process to fill the next vacancy on the court is not a narrowly partisan process, but rather an opportunity of both parties to weigh in, and ensure we place a judge on the court who can secure support from members of both parties. the reality we are in requires us over the next several days to consider what both Democrats and Republicans are doing to this body, and to consider what both Republicans and Democrats have done to erode the trust that has long lasted between us, and to consider whether we can stop the undeniable momentum towards abolishing the traditions that make the senate unique and important. Democrats, including me, are still furious at the way Judge Merrick Garland was treated last year, but the traditions and principles that have defined the Senate are crumbling, and we are poised to hasten that destruction this week. So, for my part, I hope and pray that we can yet find a way together, to find a solution. President Trump's abrupt firing of FBI Director Comey and his brief public letter raises more questions than it answers. The reasons the Trump administration cites for this action have long been public: Director Comey made announcements about the investigation into Secretary Clinton's emails that departed from longstanding FBI and DOJ guidance in the summer and fall of 2016. While Director Comey has rightly been questioned and criticized for those actions, months have gone by without any action from the Trump administration. Director Comey has also recently publicly confirmed that the FBI is currently investigating potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The President should provide a prompt, full and public explanation of why he decided to take this step, and Director Comey should be reca"
Q59315," It is well-documented by the State Department and by respected human rights organisations that Nigerian army personnel have, for many years, engaged in a pattern and practice of gross violations of human rights against the Nigerian people and others, including summary executions of prisoners, indiscriminate attacks against civilians, torture, forced disappearances and rape. Rarely have the perpetrators been prosecuted or punished. This abusive conduct not only violates the laws of war, it creates fear and loathing among the Nigerian people whose support is necessary to defeat a terrorist group like Boko HaramPresident Buhari ignores the undisputed fact that most Nigerian army units have been approved, under the Leahy Law, for U.S. training and equipment. Only those particular units against which there is credible evidence of the most heinous crimes are ineligible for U.S. aid. And even those units can again become eligible if the Nigerian Government takes effective steps to bring the responsible individuals to justice. I strongly agree with President Buhari about the need to defeat Boko Haram, and I have supported tens of millions of dollars in U.S. aid to Nigeria for that purpose. But rather than suggest that the United States is at fault for not funding murderers and rapists in the Nigerian military, he should face up to his own responsibility to effectively counter Boko Haram. He should direct his attention to the Nigerian military, and the Nigerian courts, and clean up the units implicated in such atrocities. This Trumpcare bill is a cruel and cynical hoax, played on millions upon millions of Americans who would lose all or some of their health insurance protections under this plan. From clumsy start to appalling finish, House Republicans have shown no shame in advancing a bill that, in truth, is intended to give a massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans, in the guise of a health care plan. It's only gotten worse as House leaders have had to bargain for votes. This hastily crafted bill was jammed through the House of Representatives with virtually no debate, substantive hearings or even a budget score to tally its price and its devastating effects on the families who would lose their health insurance under this legislative monstrosity. The American people -- and even those who voted for this -- have no idea how much this Trumpcare bill will cost, yet we do know that it will eviscerate vital insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions, kick more than 20 million Americans off their health insurance, and mandate devastating cuts to Medicaid. I will do all I can to prevent Senate action on this disastrous plan, or on anything that comes close to it. He was the last President of the Greatest Generation, and he leaves a lasting legacy of true and meaningful public service. While we had our share of differences over policy, his decency, his civility and his humility have never been a more important example to the nation than they are today. He skillfully steered our country after the collapse of the Soviet Union. His legacy includes working with many of us in enacting the Americans With Disabilities Act, a far-reaching civil rights achievement that has and will enrich the lives of millions of Americans, and the nation. I worked with him on a breakthrough in U.S.-Vietnam relations that involved assisting landmine victims through the Leahy War Victims Fund. But I came to know him best years earlier. My clearest insights into his character and his personality - including his sense of humor-came from our many interactions when he was President of the Senate, as Vice President, as Marcelle and I enjoyed getting to know George and Barbara. Those are fond and lasting memories that will always be with us. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the Bush family. Bernie has been a strong voice on behalf of working people across America. His strong personal feelings came through as he announced the suspension of his campaign. My fellow Vermonters have long known what so many others have seen: a consistent advocate for health care for all, for economic justice, and for a democracy that remains in the hands of the American people as it should and not in the hands of a few. He is my partner in the Senate, and my friend of decades. I look forward to continuing our partnership on behalf of Vermont in the U.S. Senate and in working together to defeat the most dangerous and incompetent president of our lifetime. The energy he has brought to this campaign for new, forward-thinking leadership in America will be important in doing that. Marcelle and I extend our deep gratitude to Bernie and Jane, who have done so much for our nation. We will work with them to make sure we have a new President in January. The images of migrant bodies washed up on the banks of the Rio Grande, and reports of children sleeping in cages without access to toothbrushes and soap, have shocked our nation's collective conscience. With "
Q516515," I think the likelihood of a BRAC will be dependent on whether the Congress makes the judgement that BRAC is necessary to make the defense expenditures more efficient and effective whether or not consolidation of activities is called for. Congress has been reluctant to do another BRAC and the administrations, both the Democratic and Republican, have sought additional BRACs and Congress has been reluctant to do that on the theory that we have done BRACs, we have affected savings but it is not necessary right now to do an additional BRAC. I'm not sure that Congress will continue to believe in that as funding becomes tighter and tighter. You see Trump saying he wants to substantially expand military spending, and you see Democrats largely and the Republicans essentially adopted the level that the Obama Administration has requested. We haven't passed any appropriation bills but in the Republican (with the) defense bill they took the president's number. So I think the administration will ask for the Pentagon to ask for us for a BRAC. It is a much easier way from a political standpoint, not partisan politics, politics of everyone representing their district standpoint to affect closure and reassignment of various activities. I don't fear a BRAC because I believe that a BRAC is occurring every day in the Pentagon. And what I mean by that is there are discussions in the Pentagon on a daily basis about `we can do what we're doing at A; we can do that over at B, and consolidate it at C.' I think that goes on all the time. The difference is: A BRAC process, you get to see the discussion go on. On the daily basis, you don't know who is talking to whom about what and therefore it is somewhat opaque. But on the other hand, i think most members think a BRAC puts their enterprise at risk. We in Southern Maryland, we have the advantage (that) we largely do research, development. test and evaluation. So no matter what the size of the force, whether you have 100 planes or 1,000 planes, you want those planes to have the best technology that is available to the warfighter and safer, but to also make it a more effective airframe. So, that's what we do. We're not necessarily dependent on the size of the force, because we look at the quality of the weapons and instruments available to them. The problem with using government as a lever, as a tool and taking hostages -- not only the 800,000 federal employees but taking all the millions and millions of people who are served by government every day hostage is -- that is very, very debilitating to our country -- essentially taking our country hostage. So what we're saying is, Mr. President, we need to negotiate. It could be hard; you can veto some of our bills, but don't shut down government in the process. So this is a bigger issue than just the wall or education or the Affordable Care Act, it's an issue of whether or not we're going to use as a continuing policy shutting down the government of the United States and undermining the confidence of our employees, the confidence of people who deal with the government, and the confidence of the international community looking to see whether the United States of America can act in a rational, responsible way. Next Tuesday, I will bring a resolution to the House Floor forcing Attorney General Barr and former White House Counsel McGahn to comply with Congressional subpoenas that have been duly issued by the House Judiciary Committee. The resolution will authorize the Judiciary Committee to pursue civil action to seek enforcement of its subpoenas in federal court. It also authorizes House Committees that have issued subpoenas as part of their oversight and investigation responsibilities to seek civil enforcement of those subpoenas when they are ignored. This Administration's systematic refusal to provide Congress with answers and cooperate with Congressional subpoenas is the biggest cover-up in American history, and Congress has a responsibility to provide oversight on behalf of the American people. Just briefly, you're going to hear the President say we walked out. We were offended deeply by his treatment of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The President, in my view, has created a crisis in the Middle East. A crisis that undermines the world's confidence in America. This crisis required a rational, reasonable discussion between those of us who've been elected by the American people to set policy. Unfortunately, the meeting deteriorated into a diatribe, as Leader Schumer has said, and very offensive accusations being made by the President of the United States. I have served with six presidents. I have been in many, many, many meetings like this. Never have I seen a President treat so disrespectfully a co-equal branch of the government of the United States. Today, House Republicans defeated an amendment by Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney that would ensure that federal contractors cannot discriminate against LGBT employees. Several Republi"
Q934898," And I see my father. My father was just wiping away the tears. Just wiping away. And I'd never seen my father cry. Never. He came down and I said, `Dad, I noticed you're crying.' And I wanted, I almost wanted him to lie to me. I wanted him to say he was sweating. He said, `Yeah, I'm crying.' I said, `Why you crying? You crying because your son became a member of Congress?' ... He said, `This is great, don't get me wrong. But I kept looking at your hand. And I realized the same blood that runs in your hand, runs in mine.... Isn't this the place where they used to call us slaves?' I said, `Yes sir.' He said, `Isn't this the place they called us three-fifths of a man?' I said, `Yes sir.' He said, `Isn't this the place they used to call us chattel?' I said, `Yes sir.' He said, `You know,' and he said these words, and I'll never forget. He said, `When I think about you being sworn in today, now I see what I could've been if I had an opportunity. From the very beginning, I said we were looking for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth in many instance we found ourselves having to um, not defend Secretary Clinton but make sure the the record was complete. And I'm glad the public had an opportunity to see all of that. When you look at what we were asking about, they were the things that went to Benghazi, the things that we were supposed to be dealing with very from the very beginning. And when the families came in, many of them with tears in their eyes, they asked us to do three things -- one, they asked us to make sure that we made sure it did not happen again, they wanted us to look for the facts, more facts than we already had and they asked for one final thing, they asked us to make sure that we don't turn this into a political football. So all we were trying to do is make sure that we defended the truth. Keep in mind, I have a nephew who, sadly, died five years ago, being robbed. And I went to visit his room the next day, and his brains were splattered on the wall. He was 20 years old, a student at Old Dominion University. And he's dead at 20. And so, I can really relate to those women, because when a child dies like that, you mourn for what could have been. And so, you know -- but I think the key for that, the reason why that was so important and powerful, is so the people understand, just trying to get people to pause and understand the pain, or try to understand it. Those women were very bold. What they did was they took their pain, turned it into a passion to do their purpose. Pain, passion, purpose. And so, I admire them, because they have taken their pain, and now they're trying to help other mothers not have to go through what they went through. Our speaker made it clear that we needed to paint a picture for America so that they could fully understand what is going on. This is a critical moment in our country's history. Don't be fooled. And it is a moment which people will be talking about and reading about 300, 400, 500 years from now. They are going to ask the question, what did you do when we had a president who knew the rules and knew that our founding fathers had done a great job of creating a Constitution and had put in all the guardrails, but never anticipated that we would have a president that would just throw away the guardrails. And that's why what happened today is so critical. It was a giant step in making sure that the American people got a picture of all of this and hopefully will look toward the future and say `we're not going to have this. ' I first of all want to say to Baltimore and to those who may be thinking about committing crimes, you're not going to get away with it. One of the reasons why we have all the expertise here today, these ten agents that will be embedded in our homicide unit, is because we want to make sure that our city is a safe city. And I said it before and I'll say it again, the police need the community, and the community need the police. There's no way that these murders can be solved unless we have the cooperation of the public. And I've stopped by here to beg the public to cooperate with the police because when you stand back and don't do anything, all you do is allow a murderer to go out there and do it again. The fact is that we need to let Mueller, counsel Mueller, finish his job, and he's been doing a pretty good job, from what I can see. And he will finish it, I'm sure, fairly soon. And we need to get more information with regard to what has happened here. The president has told us that lies are the truth and that truth are lies. So we cannot depend on his word, and so that's why we have to bring in people, put them under oath, and ask them exactly what happened. And i'm hoping that the Republicans will put their country over their party, and their country over their elections, and do the right thing and work with us to simply gather the information that we need to do what we have been sworn to do. The Committee has obtained direct eviden"
Q16751186," I know many Houstonians may feel anxious after learning of the presumptive positive COVID-19 Fort Bend County resident. I want to assure everyone that the city of Houston Health Department is closely monitoring the developments and collaborating with regional, state and federal health authorities. For the general public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 remains low. If you have not been around anyone with COVID-19 or have not visited an ongoing outbreak area, you are currently not considered to be at risk. While people need to remain vigilant, there is currently no need for average Houstonains to take out-of-the-ordinary protective actions. People should continue to practice routine healthy hygiene habits to help prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses like COVID-19, such as washing hands frequently, covering coughs and sneezes, avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth, and staying home if sick. I also remind Houstonians there is no need to go the emergency room unless you have a medical emergency. Emergency rooms need to be able to serve those with the most critical needs. If you have symptoms like cough, fever, or other respiratory problems, contact your regular doctor first. While there are currently no confirmed cases in Houston, this is a rapidly evolving situation and additional cases are expected. In light of today's wide-spread water outage, I have authorized Houston Public Works to take all necessary steps to isolate the water line break, drain the lines, and make the necessary repairs to return water pressure to normal levels as soon as possible. Repairs will take six to eight hours so we are asking the public to conserve water to help relive water pressure. We are currently under a boil water notice and you will be notified when it is rescinded. A City of Houston contractor was doing exploratory work for a City of Houston water line project in east Houston near 610 and Clinton Drive. When soil was moved from the line, the 96-inch line burst. Food service establishments without water or flushing toilets must cease operation. The Houston Health Department has dispatched sanitarians to the area. I want to thank our first responders for acting quickly and getting drivers to safety. Thankfully, no water entered any homes in the affected area. Today's water line break is a reminder of the aging infrastructure that Houston and other major cities face as we work to make improvements each day. Firefighters deserve a pay raise. They initially demanded 21 percent, then 17 percent. The City, hoping to end the impasse with the FFs, offered 9.5 percent, which will stretch the city's financial capability. The Association turned down that offer and continues to demand what the city cannot pay. Now the association is asking voters to sign a petition calling for parity between police and fire. But their structures and benefits are very different. The number of days they work per month, command staff, overtime pay and benefits are not the same and have differed over the last 15 years. What they are asking voters to sign is ill-defined and making the most simplistic assumptions could cost the city more than $40M. That would force the city to schedule layoffs in all department areas or further delay maintenance on buildings and purchase schedules for much needed equipment. The City appreciates and respects every fire fighter, but the demands of their union leadership will financially cripple the City, absent removing the revenue cap and a further tax increase. My heart is heavy this afternoon upon hearing the medical examiner has positively identified the remains found in Arkansas last week as four-year-old Maleah Davis. Maleah was a sweet, beautiful, and innocent little girl who deserved a chance to enjoy life just like any other child. She belonged to our community, and we share a collective grief. As we learn more about her death and disappearance, I ask people to focus their energy on creating lasting changes in Maleah's honor. Love your child and hold them close, volunteer at a shelter for women and children, support foster organizations or make a donation to your favorite charity in Maleah's name. In Maleah's memory, I have approved a request for Sunday June 9, to turn the lights of Houston city hall pink, which was her favorite color. Just as the light will shine in her memory, we must continue to shine a light on the horrific circumstances that lead to her death and make a promise to protect all children in our community. As mayor of the country's fourth largest city, I resolve to continue building a stronger and more resilient Houston. We have made exceptional strides in expanding technology and innovation, creating opportunities for entrepreneurs and job seekers, while increasing tourism, economic and trade opportunities. While many have recovered after Hurricane Harvey, there are thousands of Houstonians who are still out of their homes. "
Q32620," Veterans Day is special to me. It's a day when I often get to spend time with fellow veterans from many different generations, share stories, and remember our brothers and sisters who never made that long trip home. We will never forget. Sen. Mazie Hirono and I worked together for years on legislation that finally awards the well-deserved Congressional Gold Medal to WWII Filipino veterans -- legislation that Barack Obama signed into law as one of his final acts as president. Last month, Mazie and I welcomed many of these veterans to the US Capitol, where we presented this long-overdue recognition to heroes like Sixto Tabay, the last living WWII Filipino veteran on Kauaʻi, and around 200,000 others who served. ADVERTISEMENT Recently, I hosted a screening of the film `Go for Broke: Origins' at the US Capitol in honor of the 100th Infantry Battalion/442nd Regimental Combat Team, units created in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, which were made up of young Japanese-American men who volunteered to serve in the US Army, despite facing bigotry and prejudice as their families and loved ones were thrown into internment camps. Our late Senator Daniel Inouye is featured in the film as a young man who volunteered to fight for freedom alongside thousands of others. Through their courage, valor, and sacrifice, the 442nd became the most highly decorated unit in Army history. I could share so many stories of the courage and sacrifice displayed by the men and women that I had the privilege of serving with during my deployments to the Middle East. People of all walks of life -- different religions, races, political ideologies, and more -- all setting aside differences and coming together with one common goal: service to our country. It is this selflessness by our nation's veterans that should inspire us all this Veterans Day -- and every day. They have shown us through their example and their lives what `service and sacrifice' really means, and how we can all find ways to set aside our own differences, respect and treat each other with aloha, and work together for the good of our communities, our country, and humanity. Today, let us reflect on how we can honor our nation's veterans by living aloha and being of service in our own lives. The reason why she's doing this is because ultimately, she knows that she can't control me. That I stand for -- I stand against everything that she represents, and that if I'm elected president, if I'm the Democratic nominee and elected president, that she won't be able to control me, she won't be able to manipulate me, she won't be able to continue to work from behind the curtain, to continue these regime change wars that have been so costly. Thousands of my sisters and brothers in uniform were killed in Iraq, a war that she championed. Their blood is on her hands. I am calling for an end to these regime change wars. This is why she's speaking out strongly and smearing my character and trying to undermine my campaign. And just as she is doing this to me, this is what will happen to anybody who is doing the same... the warmongering foreign policy establishment who are conducting this coordinated smear campaign and now, we know exactly why. It's because I'm standing up and speaking out strongly against the Hillary Clinton legacy, the warmongering legacy of waging these --... regime change wars, continuing to escalate these tensions between the United States, nuclear-armed countries like Russia and China, this nuclear arms race, bringing more profits to the military industrial complex. As president, I will end these counterproductive policies, these regime change wars, this new Cold War and arms race, and redirect our taxpayer dollars back towards serving the needs of our people right here at home. President Trump yesterday offered to place our military -- my brothers and sisters in uniform -- under the command of Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, the dictator of the Islamist Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Mr. President, as you know, I have never engaged in hateful rhetoric against you or your family, and I never will. But your offering our military assets to the dictator of Saudi Arabia to use as he sees fit, is a betrayal of my brothers and sisters in uniform who are ready to put our lives on the line for our country -- not for the Islamist dictator of Saudi Arabia. For you to think that you can pimp out our proud men and women in uniform to the Prince of Saudi Arabia is disgraceful and once again shows that you are unfit to be the commander-in-chief. As a member of Congress and as a soldier, I and all of my brothers and sisters in uniform have taken an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America, and nothing in our Constitution gives you the power to go to war without the express consent of Congress, what to speak of giving you the power to offer our military to a foreign power like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to use as they wish. In short, your words and acti"
Q23685," In the mid 1700's the Coastal and Piedmont regions of North Carolina were distinctly different and separate. Because the lifestyle of the Piedmont settler was primarily farming for their own family and barter of their crops and services with their neighbors, they didn't produce a monetary income so had little to no cash when it came time to pay taxes. As a result, many of the farmers fell into significant debt. Many of these Piedmont settler farmers believed they were being overtaxed by the county and Colonial officials in Hillsborough and that too much was expected of their modest yeoman farms. Like their Virginia and Massachusetts counterparts, the farmers of Orange County resisted taxation without representation. Some of the unhappy farmers wrote their complaints in Articles known as the Regulator Advertisements. Hostility between the regulators and the government came to a head in 1771. In May, Governor Tryon marched more than 1,000 local militiamen to Hillsborough and then on to Alamance Creek, in the western part of the county, where 2,000 Regulators were meeting. On the evening of May 15, Tryon received word that the Regulators were camped about six miles away. The next morning, at about 8:00 am, Tryon's troops set out to a field about one-half mile from the camp of the Regulators, and there engaged in the Battle of Alamance. ... holy scriptures, in the Bible, Old Testament, New Testament, the Quran and so forth have been misinterpreted by men who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques. And they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God. This is a very serious problem. It's ordinarily not addressed. A number of years ago, in the year 2000, I had been a Baptist, a Southern Baptist for 70 years -- -- I still teach Sunday school every Sunday; I'll be teaching this Sunday as well -- -- but the Southern Baptist Convention in the year 2000 decided that women should play a secondary position, a subservient position to men. So they issued an edict, in effect, that prevents women from being priests, pastors, deacons in the church, or chaplains in the military, and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary, they cannot teach if a boy is in the room, because you can find verses in the Bible, there's over 30,000 verses in the Bible, that say that a woman shouldn't teach a man, and so forth. But the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position... This Voyager spacecraft was constructed by the United States of America. We are a community of 240 million human beings among the more than 4 billion who inhabit the planet Earth. We human beings are still divided into nation states, but these states are rapidly becoming a single global civilization. We cast this message into the cosmos. It is likely to survive a billion years into our future, when our civilization is profoundly altered and the surface of the Earth may be vastly changed. Of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, some -- perhaps many -- may have inhabited planets and spacefaring civilizations. If one such civilization intercepts Voyager and can understand these recorded contents, here is our message: This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts, and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination, and our good will in a vast and awesome universe. And that involves, in most cases, going to special interest groups who hope they can get a favor after the election is over.... We've not made any progress on the extremely distorting effect of high finance being requisite for any successful candidate. If you look at the list of candidates now that are prominently mentioned for president, almost all of them who have any chance at all are millionaires or multimillionaires. And this is not an accident. An average person like I was, just a peanut farmer back in 1976, you know, we won with practically no money because we campaigned all over the country and built up a grassroots organization.... I think nowadays that would be absolutely impossible, which means that there's a criterion for success in American politics now -- the Democratic or Republican Party -- and that is extreme wealth or access to major wealth. And we are the only democratic nation in the world, in the Western world, within which that blight or cancer is affecting our system. What the officials have always demanded is direct talks with the United States, leading to a permanent peace treaty to replace the still-prevailing 1953 cease-fire that has failed to end the Korean conflict. They want an end to sanctions, a guarantee that there will be "
Q1282411," Even in the midst of the worst drug crisis our nation has ever seen, the FDA once again is going out of its way to approve a new super-charged painkiller that would only worsen the opioid epidemic. It makes no sense to approve an opioid painkiller that has no benefits over similar medications and against the advice of experts. I call on the FDA to reject the vote of the advisory committee and stop the approval of this dangerously unnecessary opioid medication. Per this statement, it appears that Markey may be unaware of the fact that sufentanil is already an FDA-approved drug. Though sufentanil itself in its current IV form may not have any particular benefits over any other opioids in terms of its efficacy treating acute pain, Dsuvia certainly offers tangible benefits over alternatives. First, Dsuvia is easier and safer to administer than the current standard-of-care treatment, and is less, rather than more, likely to be abused - the amount of sufentanil in just one 5 mL vial of a 50 mcg/mL sufentanil citrate solution is more than the amount contained in 8 Dsuvia single-use applicators. Below, I've provided a picture of a Dsuvia applicator: Source: AcelRx Form 8-K Now, as a comparison, I've included a picture of a 5 mL vial-sufentanil citrate is commonly packaged in 1, 2, and 5mL vials. Though the picture below is not a medical vial, as it was difficult to find any images demonstrating the exact dimensions of a medical vial, the image I selected can help give readers a good idea of the size of a sufentanil citrate vial. The vial above is actually taller and narrower than most sufentanil vials - as such, a vial of sufentanil citrate would probably be around 2 It's not as galvanized as the Democratic base. It's not as galvanized as those who were outraged at the way in which Dr. Blasey Ford was treated before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the entire process for the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh. What we are seeing here is a historic uprising, especially of women in our country who really do feel that this president has to have a check be placed upon him. Otherwise preexisting conditions, which are protections for those who have health care needs, or the entire Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade can all just be swept away. It can be completely overturned by Brett Kavanaugh's vote on the Supreme Court. This is going to be a referendum on Donald Trump, on Brett Kavanaugh, on the key votes, which he can now cast, that undermines protections for women in our country and families in general. This resolution condemns Chechnyan officials' torture, murder, and incitement of so-called honor killings of men who are or are suspected of being gay, calls for an end to the persecution, and calls on Russian authorities to investigate it, punish the perpetrators, and protect the human rights of all citizens. We have 45 senators -- cosponsors on both sides of the aisle... I introduced it with Senator Toomey to ensure that it would be bipartisan, and I think it's an important statement for the Senate to make, that we stand united with Chechnya's LGBTQ community, who are victims of this cruel and murderous treatment at the hands of the Chechnyan officials who govern under the authority of Russia and it is important for us to persistently speak against inhumane treatment of human beings, no matter where they are on the planet. Whether it was the courage of a soldier during war, the courage of a legislator to reach across the aisle, or the courage of a husband and father to face a diagnosis with dignity and resolve, John McCain was a hero. I was honored to work with John on legislation to end the practice of extraordinary rendition. He understood from the most personal of experiences that torture is illegal and ineffective and that our nation's moral standing should never be compromised by such barbarism. From global warming to health care, John McCain put country ahead of party and served as an example to legislators everywhere. We will forever miss his heroism, his integrity, and his endless devotion to country. I mourn the death of this once and always maverick. My prayers are with his family and loved ones. President Trump has called global warming a hoax. He has assembled a cabinet of big oil all-stars. Fear is rampant across the federal government in terms of the scientists who work there every day. But on our side, we have a hundred years of scientific reality. We are going to defend our fuel economy standards; we are going to defend our appliance efficiency standards; our Congressional delegation is going to make sure that incentives for wind and solar investments stay on the books. Here's why: in 2016, there were 50,000 coal miners in the United States. In 2016, 50,000 new people got hired in the solar industry alone. But by 2020, there are going to be 500,000 people working in the solar and wind industries in the United States. The formation of this caucus is intended to highlight the importance of beating this"
Q723295," For years now, Attorney General Brian Frosh and I have been working to end discriminatory profiling on the state and local levels, respectively. His guidance for Maryland law enforcement instructs officers not to improperly consider race, ethnicity, gender, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability or gender identity to any degree during police operations and investigations. This guidance builds on the 2014 federal guidance from the Justice Department prohibiting the use discriminatory profiling by federal law enforcement officers, and I hope the Maryland guidance will spur a national trend in ending the counterproductive practice and restoring the trust between law enforcement and the communities they protect. Discriminatory profiling has no place in America. It doesn't work, it breeds mistrust, and we have seen that it can be deadly. Civil rights should not evaporate or be forfeited after crossing a state line. I will continue to call on my colleagues in the House and Senate to pass my legislation, the End Racial Profiling Act, which would prohibit discriminatory profiling -- including but not limited to racial profiling -- by law enforcement at all levels, nationwide. I have also included language ending discriminatory profiling in the BALTIMORE Act, along with other common sense reforms to revitalize our cities and make needed reforms to our criminal justice system. This is a strong step forward for civil rights in Maryland and I look forward to building on this momentum as we continue to work to end discriminatory profiling everywhere in America. There is no doubt that Mr. Mnuchin is smart and has made a lot of money during his career, but it does not necessarily make him qualified to steer America's economy. Based on my personal meeting with Mr. Mnuchin, his performance during his confirmation hearing, and his responses -- or non-responses -- to follow up questions for the record, I cannot be sure that Mr. Mnuchin is adequately prepared for the enormous responsibilities of U.S. Treasury Secretary. We need someone who has given some serious thought to the broad responsibilities and decisions that will affect every resident of this country. This includes showing, to Congress and to the American public, at least some inclination to answer high-level questions about tax policy, trade policy, and economic growth. I am deeply concerned that Mr. Mnuchin's uncompromising view that tax cuts for the wealthy naturally equal massive economic growth -- without being able to point to any historical instance or analysis where this has been the case -- will leave our most vulnerable Marylanders behind and will drive our country further into debt. Because of these views, and because I am not at all assured that Mr. Mnuchin's experiences will lead to him being a successful advocate for the financial well-being of all Americans, I will oppose his nomination. We don't want that to happen. But the risk of a nuclear SEE ALSO: Michael McCaul warns D.C. airspace vulnerable to drones, small aircraft The Senate Foreign Relations Committee cleared a calibrated approach to the ongoing negotiations last week, with Republicans and Democrats unanimously approving a bill that would force any SEE ALSO: Bernie Sanders says he would seek victory, not just soap box, in presidential run Under the Senate deal, the administration couldn't lift any of the sanctions Congress has placed on Iran's nuclear program until it presents all the details to Capitol Hill, and it gives lawmakers a chance to have a say. Unless Congress votes to reject the deal - and a disciplined Democratic caucus can prevent that from happening-Mr. Obama could accept the new restraints, saying it doesn't think the bill would disrupt the negotiations midstream since it only gives Congress a crack once the president's team finishes its work. Lawmakers have said they aren't prejudging the nuclear deal, which Mr. Obama's team is still negotiating with Iran, racing a self-imposed end-of-June deadline to flesh out the details of the framework that all sides reached earlier this month., I've been in Congress since 1987, and my first day in Congress I joined the caucus on Soviet Jewry. And shortly thereafter, Shoshana was the president of the National Council for Soviet Jewry, so every night I had to report back what I was doing to help save Soviet Jews. I was there at the march in Washington in 1989. I've seen it through every facet. We are so proud of the role Shoshana played. She stood up to the commercial interests of this country. She said, America stands for something more fundamental than just commerce -- we stand for basic human rights. Shoshana stood up to presidents. She stood up to the State Department. And she stood up to the Soviet Union. Jews are safer today because of Shoshana's leadership on behalf of Soviet Jews. She taught us that people can change policy. There's no question that in the State Department, this was not a top priority then. The "
Q56486914," I have full faith and confidence in Eddie Johnson as the leader of the Chicago Police Department. Over the years, I have spoken at length with Superintendent Johnson about the shooting of Laquan McDonald, the police response that night and the days after. Based on these discussions and my knowledge from other sources, there is nothing that gives me pause about the Superintendent's conduct related to that tragic event. Laquan McDonald's Great-Uncle Calls for Calm After Sentence Laquan McDonald's great-uncle Marvin Hunter calls for calm after the sentence handed down to former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke. (Published Friday, Jan. 18, 2019) To the contrary, from a beat officer to leading the Chicago Police Department, Superintendent Johnson has been a champion for real, lasting police reform in Chicago over the past 31 years -- and remains so to this day. Under his leadership, the Chicago Police Department has taken critical steps forward to improve transparency, drive changes set forward in the consent decree, and, most importantly, ensure police accountability department-wide while rebuilding the trust between the police and the community they serve. I stand fully behind the Superintendent as we work toward our shared goal of building safer and stronger neighborhoods across the city.

The indictment alleges that Ald. Burke used his position and the tools of government to facilitate a criminal enterprise to enrich himself and cheat the residents of this city. No official in this city-elected or appointed - should ever profit from his or her office. Given the serious nature of the allegations, and particularly the allegations that he abused his position as chairman of the Finance committee, Alderman Burke must resign immediately. Given the serious criminal liability he faces, Alderman Burke can no longer continue to do his job honorably or effectively. It is in the best interests of all that he step aside so that the residents of the 14th ward can be properly represented. I have also directed the City's Corporation Counsel to investigate whether any current city employees or vendors were complicit in facilitating the crimes alleged in the superseding indictment. If so, we will not hesitate to take decisive actions against anyone whose conduct violated any laws or ethical rules. They feel like the government isn't relevant to them. They feel it constantly takes, and in some instances, actually causes them harm. I think it's critically important that we have to rebuild that basic relationship between citizens, elected officials, and institutions of government. It is critical to the survival of our democracy. It's a very a big issue. We have to completely abandon this `us vs. them' mentality; it's an awful way of governance and it distances people from institutions of government in our democracy. It makes people feel like elected officials are solely politicians looking out for their own self-interests, without any regard for what is in the best interest of their own constituents. This is undeniably big news but it doesn't change what we're fighting for. It doesn't change the needs of people all across this city. We live in a city where violence is still far too prevalent as we see through the tragic weekend statistics. We live in a city where many people continue to live in poverty and struggle with chronic unemployment or just difficulty in trying to make ends meet. We still live in a city where children must travel long distances each morning in hopes of a decent education as we saw today. The us versus them mentality continues to divide our communities and we still need a leader to unite our city. I plan to be that leader. We all know what the range of different options are, a lot of it's going to depend on whether or not we are able to build some consensus in Springfield about wha"
Q5607720," Governor Whitmer believes that every child in Michigan deserves a quality public education that gets them on a path to a good job. She remains committed to hearing from school board members, community leaders, and legislators about their concerns and ideas, and is open to any viable plan that will help students get on a path to success and resolve the district's more than $18 million debt. The plan the state put on the table is the only solution we've found that puts students first and tackles the financial problems the Benton Harbor district is facing. Governor Whitmer extended the state's original deadline for the school board to make a decision regarding the state's proposal because she wants to make sure everyone's voice is heard and all viable options get to the table. The governor's first priority is and always has been ensuring Benton Harbor students can get on track to earn a postsecondary degree and build a life for themselves here in Michigan. The work that Grand Valley is doing should serve as a model for colleges and universities across the state. I want to congratulate President Haas on his upcoming retirement and thank him for his transformative leadership at GVSU over the last 13 years. I look forward to partnering with incoming President Philomena Mantella to continue GVSU's legacy of helping our students access higher education, complete degrees, and prosper here in Michigan. Michigan is a great state because of the diverse people who call it home, and we have a responsibility to expand opportunities for everyone here and make sure that every student, no matter their community, can get on a path to postsecondary success. I'm excited to partner with our state universities and community colleges to make sure we continue working to better serve students of color here in Michigan. Every Michigander deserves an affordable postsecondary education, and Wayne State has been a tremendous leader on this issue. Earlier this year, I announced a statewide goal of reaching 60 percent of Michiganders with a postsecondary degree or certificate by 2030, and the Heart of Detroit Tuition Pledge will bring us one step closer to meeting that goal. I'm eager to work with leaders like Mayor Duggan, President Wilson, and anyone else who wants to bring down the cost of a college education for everyone in Michigan. We can start by implementing the MI Opportunity Scholarship that I announced earlier this year, which will ensure every high school graduate has a tuition-free pathway to a community college education, and ensure that a four-year degree is much more affordable for low - and middle-income families. Let's get to work. We've done well in terms of getting ventilators from FEMA, we've gotten about 700 ventilators from FEMA. Maybe 1,400, if we can double people up which is a possibility. I am not saying it works but it could work. What we know is we probably need thousands more. And so I just share that because we don't know how our bodies are going to react to COVID-19. What might be a cold feeling, you know, feeling like I have a bad flu for me could be fatal to my husband. And that's true for households across the state. And that's precisely why it's important each of us act as if we are all carrying COVID-19. We do the physical distancing and hand washing and all of the important hygienic suggestions by the CDC because it is really critical we don't fill those off-site alternative care places up. Today's signing of two supplemental budget bills will provide new state funding of $150 million to bolster response efforts. To date, the state has already expended more than $130 million to secure more than 20 million masks, more than 2,000 ventilators, nearly 9 million ounces of hand sanitizer, more than 255,000 boxes of gloves, 2.4 million gowns, more than 2,000 beds, 210,000 testing supplies, 3,000 thermometers, 185,000 face shields, 22,000 cartons of disinfecting wipes, as well as other needed supplies. The additional funding provided today, along with the supplies and funding provided by the federal government, helps ensure that Michigan has the necessary resources to save lives and slow the spread of COVID-19. This has to be all hands on deck. Cutting red tape, moving as quickly as we possibly can, and being aggressive and smart about our reaction. And so to hear the leader of the federal government tell us to work around the federal government because it's too slow is just -- it's kind of mind-boggling, to be honest. We are pulling out all the stops in Michigan. Businesses here in Michigan that are redoubling their efforts to make sure that we're able to access all of the kinds of equipment that we need, but we need the federal government to work. We need respirators and ventilators and personal protection equipment. We need more test kits and the resources to process those test kits in a quick, expedited manner. I'm coming to you now to ask for your help. Due to extremely high demand for natural gas with "
Q513091," Our economy has done well despite some of the pronouncements about its demise.... Every time we go up against these right wing Republicans who say, `well, slash here, slash here, slash there,' I mean, look at our neighbor to the east. Every time. Compare Minnesota's economy with the economies of the Republican governors who are running for president. We beat them hands down on everything. They cut taxes for the rich, you know, slashed public employee rights, they've gone for Right to Work, they've opposed any increase to the minimum wage. And we got better unemployment rate, better overall employment rate, a higher per capita GDP, productivity. We beat them every which way because we invest in our people. And I'll back the people of Minnesota and give them more of what they need and they are going to turn around and create a better state. DNR would use available Game and Fish Fund money to improve fisheries population surveys, create forest wildlife habitat, expand grassland and prairie habitat, improve monitoring and management of wildlife populations and create more outdoor opportunities for kids and families. Dayton's DNR budget seeks $5.4 million in fiscal year 2016, which begins July 1, and $5.1 million in fiscal 2017. Those expenditures would trigger reimbursements from the federal government of $6.1 million, reducing the state's two-year, $10.5 million cost to $4.4 million. No money would come from the state's general fund. The federal reimbursements are appropriated to states based on excise taxes gained from gun and ammunition sales and the sale of certain other outdoor equipment.. I congratulate Minnesota's students, teachers, administrators, and parents for their tremendous achievements! This report is great news for our students, who are completing their high school educations better prepared for college and career training than ever before. We have made significant progress to close disparities in our education system, with high school graduation rates for students of color up by more than 11 percentage points since 2012. Despite this progress, unacceptable disparities persist among students of color in our schools. These gaps underscore the need for continued improvements in early education, K-12, and higher education systems to eliminate disparities and ensure better educational opportunities for all Minnesotans. I extend my deepest condolences to the family, friends, and community of Philando Castile. Our state today grieves with them. This morning, I spoke by phone with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough to request that the U.S. Department of Justice begin an immediate independent federal investigation into this matter. Overnight, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension began an independent investigation at the state level. They are currently collecting all necessary evidence, and interviewing witnesses, to determine what happened, and to assure that justice in this case is served. I will do everything in my power to help protect the integrity of that investigation, to ensure a proper and just outcome for all involved. I extend again my deepest condolences to Philando Castile's family, to his friends, and to his community. Minnesotans continue to grieve with them, for their horrible loss. Mr. Castile's death was a terrible tragedy, with devastating consequences for everyone involved. I will continue to do all I can to help our state heal. There are thousands of law enforcement officers, who courageously risk their lives to protect our communities, and many other dedicated Minnesotans, who are working to correct the injustices in our state. I believe that, working together, we can make the changes necessary to secure both safety and justice, in all of our communities, for all Minnesotans. It's just throwing muck into these good operations... We've got darn good agencies and darn good agency heads and they've improved a heck of a lot from when I took office and they need to continue to improve and they're making that as near impossible as they can with this bill. They are people who don't believe in government and they think that government does everything badly and when they get elected as they have been they go out and prove themselves correct and they defund the programs or they destroy the programs and then come back and say, `See? We made it worse. Re-elect us and we'll make it worse again.' That's what we're up against. It is with tremendous sorrow that the Detroit Pistons organization acknowledges the passing of Flip Saunders. He will be remembered by Pistons fans as one of the franchise's most successful head coaches-leading the club to three consecutive Eastern Conference Finals appearances and a franchise-record 64 wins in 2005-06. Flip was a great ambassador for the Metro Detroit community and had a positive influence on those who had the opportunity to spend time with him. We send our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Debbie, his children Ryan, Mindy, Rachel, Kimberly and al"
Q16189318," Our primary concern is and always has been the health and well-being of Maui's residents and visitors as we work to privatize Maui region hospitals. We are committed to a successful transfer and transition to a new Maui health care system for all stakeholders, which includes our employees. However, this transaction must be done correctly for the common good. The concerns expressed in my veto message have not changed. Three areas of concern remain: The bill jeopardizes the Employees Retirement System's tax exempt status. The bill does not appropriate funds for lump-sum cash payments for affected employees. The bill adds an additional unfunded liability of about $17.2 million to the ERS and $18.4 million to the Employer Union Benefits Trust Fund (EUTF). This puts the state's long-term financial position, along with its bond ratings in jeopardy. Bond ratings determine what the state pays in interest on borrowed funds. The next steps for my administration include: Conferring with the attorney general to assess and evaluate the impact of the veto override. Continuing to work in good faith with the UPW to bring resolution to the federal court injunction and to finalize the details. We are close to an agreement. Continuing to work on a smooth transition in order to provide a new system of health care for Maui. This is an historic, complex multi-stakeholder transformation and we are optimistic that we will resolve all unforeseen issues. In the interim, I am confident that the existing Maui hospital staff and operations team will continue to provide quality health care services to the people of Maui. I'm honored and humbled to serve the residents of the State of Hawaiʻi as their director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. Our team will focus on diligently analyzing the increasing availability of labor market data to identify opportunities for growing Hawaiʻi's labor force within each industry sector throughout our state. Building on our stateʻs history of working together, our team will continue to work in partnership with Hawaiʻi's businesses, labor organizations, education/training providers and state/county leaders to do our very best at developing a workforce that has both the technical and employability skills essential to providing a competitive advantage to Hawaiʻi's businesses in the global economy, One of the reasons I did sign the emergency declaration for the state ahead of landfall is allow us to preposition equipment and personnel. As you know, with the last Hurricane Lane, there was significant rain and landslides along on the east side, Hana, of Maui and so our concern at this point in time is that there's lots of saturation in the area, a lot of the area is unstable and prone to additional landslides, so we wanted to preposition road-clearing equipment in Hana with personnel so that should there be a landslide along the Hana Highway, that we would be able to address it from either the Hana side or Kahului side to enable us to restore and repair the road as quickly as possible, Our team has improved our financial standing saving the state hundreds of millions in interest payments and rekindled long-stalled infrastructure projects. I kept my promise to cool schools, protected over 40,000 acres of watershed forests on four islands, and ended favoritism and pay to play cronyism in state government, opening up more contracts to our local small businesses. I am also proud of how my administration has taken on the Trump Administration when they have put Hawaii's and the nation's values and rights in jeopardy, doing more than most other governors to fight unfair and discriminatory policies coming out of Congress and the White House. The areas where precautions are required for people are in lower Puna where lava is flowing and downwind from there on the island of Hawaiʻi, particularly if they have respiratory problems. Because of heavy emissions of vog, as well as occasional bursts of ash plumes from the Kīlauea summit, the southeast portions of the island are also routinely experiencing concerning conditions. Those visiting areas south of Hilo should stay alert for air quality updates, especially when wind conditions change. Fortunately, when trade winds are blowing, the vog and ash routinely move in a southwesterly direction and out to sea away from the Hawaiian Islands.

Q258825," In the last budget, the state Legislature approved a measure requiring able-bodied adults with no dependents to be screened for illegal drug usage in order to receive state food assistance. Wisconsin is now seeking a federal waiver to be able to implement the changes to the FoodShare program, beginning Nov. 1, 2018. The state Department of Health Services held a public hearing in Green Bay Monday which was sparsely attended. Two people gave testimony. One of them was Vanessa Kuettel, a staff attorney for Legal Action of Wisconsin. She said, the rule change violates the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibiting unreasonable search and seizure. Kuettel added that federal law already requires drug testing for benefit applicants who have been convicted of felony drug crimes within the last five years. `That would be individualized suspicion for the drug testing,' Kuettel told reporters. She said the Wisconsin rule goes beyond that standard and that, `this proposal here is talking about suspicion-less drug testing and that's what's going to have a negative impact on our clients because... it will then impeded their access to food.' DHS' Medicaid Director Michael Heifetz said some aspects of the rule change are still in question including what kinds of drug tests will be conducted and what governmental entity will pay for them. Gov. Scott Walker is part of a contingent of five Midwestern governors visiting Japan and South Korea this week. According to press release from Walker's office, the eight-day trade mission is aimed at boosting Wisconsin exports. Other governors on the trip include: Rick Snyder of Michigan, Eric Holcomb of Indiana, Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, and Bruce Rauner of Illinois. The group belongs to the Midwest U.S.-Japan Association. In Japan, Walker said he met with executives from Japanese soy sauce maker Kikkoman, which has long had a Wisconsin presence, and Komatsu, a Japanese corporation that manufactures construction, mining and military equipment. Komatsu recently bought Wisconsin's Joy Global, a manufacturing company located in Milwaukee. Walker also met with executives from Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that is expected to build a large electronics plant in southeastern Wisconsin. In addition to speaking with Foxconn executives, he spent time talking with executives from companies interested in being suppliers to the plant. `Many of the participants were very interested in how they could come to Wisconsin and partner for that new ecosystem,' Walker said. It is clearer than ever that the path to continue making health care work better for patients and families isn't through partisanship or backroom deals. It is through working across the aisle, transparency, and coming together to find common ground where we can. I'm pleased to announce with Chairman Alexander that our first two bipartisan hearings in the HELP Committee will be dedicated to hearing from state insurance commissioners and governors from across the country. These state leaders understand full well the challenges facing health care today and many have been outspoken about how the uncertainty caused by this Administration has impacted the individual insurance market and therefore families' premiums for 2018. Through these and other planned public hearings, we have the critical opportunity to work together toward an agreement by the end of September to help prevent millions of patients and families from paying more for the care they need next year. It is my hope that we can act quickly and in a responsible manner that builds upon our efforts to make health care more affordable, accessible, and higher quality for all. Price, alongside politicians like Mike Pence, have made it their mission in Congress to destroy the ACA and attack Planned Parenthood and women's health care -- despite mounting evidence from medical experts and researchers that this agenda will devastate women and communities across the country. Women across America are afraid that they will lose their health care and access to no-copay birth control -- sending IUD requests at Planned Parenthood health centers sky high following the election. The Price-Pence agenda will lock in systemic inequality in our health system and doubly harm women of color, immigrant communities and those living in rural areas. So while Tom Price may not think women have problems accessing birth control and health care now, real women and medical experts tell a different story. And after witnessing Rep. Price repeatedly dodge questions about whether he would rip away the benefit that gave 55 million women access to no-copay birth control, the Senate should reject this nomination without hesitation. We can do it on our own time, in our own homes -- even from our phones. But for far too many individuals and families -- including those from communities of color, people with disabilities, low-income households, and rural communities -- getting online isn't so easy to do, and I s"
Q1827902," Hi, I'm Senator Brian Schatz from Hawaii. This week marked the first 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency, and it was unlike anything anyone has ever seen before. From the nominations of unqualified cabinet secretaries like Betsy DeVos and Scott Pruitt, to the failed attempt at banning Muslim refugees from our country, this administration and this Congress have governed with cruelty and have broken every promise they made to the American people. During the campaign, we heard the President promise he would keep jobs here at home, buy and hire American, and hold countries like China accountable for their unfair trade practices. But as President, Donald Trump has proposed deep cuts to job training programs, refused to label China a currency manipulator, and has done nothing to stop companies from outsourcing jobs. To get elected, Donald Trump promised health insurance for everybody but what we saw was an attempt to strip 24 million people of their health care. What we saw was an attempt to impose an age tax that would have allowed insurance companies to charge you more as you got older for your health insurance. As a candidate, Donald Trump promised time and time again to drain the swamp. But he has filled the swamp in his first 100 days. He has done the opposite, filling his administration with lobbyists and friends. And his conflicts of interests and the ongoing investigation into his Russian ties continue to cast a shadow over his Administration and its policies. President Trump made a lot of promises to make life better for working - and middle-class Americans. But when he proposed his first budget, it was clear his priorities are making life better for the rich, not for every day Americans. The American people expect bipartisan compromise from the President and the Congress. But unless the President changes his approach and reaches out to the Democrats, the next 100 days will be just like the first: a series of broken promises to the families of America. You know, for people making $30,000 or less, very shortly, they will see a 10% increase. Most of the benefit goes to the very wealthiest individuals and also to corporations. And you know, the message from the 2016 election, I thought, was that there was this populist uprising, and it is shocking to me, really shocking, that they took $1.5 trillion worth of deficit spending and still couldn't find enough money to do a straightforward middle class tax cut. It's not that hard to do a middle class tax cut if you're deficit financing it. They freed up $1.5 trillion and they still couldn't do a straightforward middle-class tax cut. And my constituents are very strongly against this bill. Obviously, some people will see some tax relief, but the vast majority of people understand that this is essentially a wealth transfer from people who work for a living to people who already have wealth. Our bill reflects the bipartisan tradition of this subcommittee and delivers strong funding that supports our veterans, service members and their families. The increased funding in this bill will help our veterans, ensuring in-house medical care is available for more veterans, funding additional research, increasing staffing to process veterans disability claims appeals, and increasing the amount of money available for State Extended Care Facilities. But we are operating in the shadow of unsustainable BCA caps, and the additional funding for VA comes at the expense of other important domestic programs, including medical research, education, transportation and other national priorities. We need a bipartisan budget agreement to deal with this so that we can get back to regular order and pass appropriations bills. It' s an indicator of how rushed this is. They didn' t even consult with the Senate. They didn' t consult with the parliamentarian to make sure that it complies with the rules that they' re using to avoid working with Democrats. They' re doing something called reconciliation which allows them to do this on a party line vote but they' re in such a rush that they made several mistakes and so we' re actually going to have to excise those offending provisions and then they' re going to have to take a re-vote. But to me, it' s emblematic of what happens when you take major legislation conceive of it in the dark and rush it through lots and lots of things are going to come out not just over the next several days but months and years. We' re going to learn how awful this tax bill is. I am pleased with the Administration's proposal of a time-limited authorization specifically for ISIL, but I have reservation about other provisions in the request. I am troubled by the ambiguity regarding our commitment of ground troops as well as the lack of specificity about what individuals and groups will be considered associated with ISIL. Without that specificity, Congress risks authorizing a war against an ever expanding list of persons and organizations in an ever growing number of coun"
Q6103950," Well, look, we're going to have to do a lot. There's no doubt that the economy is being significantly harmed by the delays that the federal government. You know, had during January and February, getting going dealing with this. That's why we've all had to go on stay-at-home orders or keeping kids at home, closing bars and restaurants, and so on. So what would I like? First, we've got to fund unemployment. There's no question about that. And the federal government needs to step up. It appears to be stepping up on that. As far as sending checks to individuals, I certainly think that that should be, you know, means-tested. There's no reason to send a check to Michael Bloomberg, you know, for $1,000. So if that's something the federal government decides to do, fine. But there's another thing that isn't being talked about. We're having to spend money to do things that are frankly the job of the federal government. But I'm doing it, across the country our budgets will be slammed, our revenues are going down, no doubt precipitously and our spending has to go up because we're saving people's lives and we're trying to at least put some money in their pockets. So we need help. We would like block grants to the states. We've got to go back, no doubt, to the 2008 era to look at what was done there and try and replicate those, in fact, bigger because that is what is necessary in this time of national emergency. On the first day of a new administration, we're enshrining our state's values to create real and lasting opportunity for the middle class. For hardworking people across Illinois, know that your state government has your back. Whether it's pay equity for women, prosecuting employers who engage in wage theft, instituting prevailing wage requirements, using project labor agreements, restoring state employees' steps, or promoting diversity in state contracts, these steps are the first of many to take bold action to support working families. This work is far from done, and I look forward to continuing to work with the General Assembly to advance core priorities so working families across Illinois can thrive. You talked about a gas tax... We're challenged to come up with the dollars that we need for our highway system and for our roads. So in some states, they have done tests recently for a VMT tax... It's only fair if you're on a road and traveling on that road that you should pay your fair share on the road like everybody else is paying. So I think it's something we should look at. We have to be careful about how it gets implemented and that's why it should only be a test at this point. I guess I'm letting you know that I recognize the challenge that we have in coming up with the dollars for our roads, particularly in that gas tax arena, and that we've got to look for different ways to fund it. After nearly a decade of delay, I applaud the House and Senate for passing a living wage with the fierce urgency this moment requires. Phasing in the minimum wage over the next six years will put $6,300 a year into the pockets of nearly a quarter of our state's workforce and billions of dollars into local economies in every corner of our state. Whether you're a home healthcare provider in McLeansboro or a janitor in Rockford, hardworking men and women across Illinois deserve a raise and will get one. After campaigning on a promise to put Springfield back on the side of working families, I will proudly sign this historic legislation in the days to come. In the two classes Pritzker took with C. Eric Lincoln -- professor of religion and culture at Duke from 1976 to 1993 and author of books on black Muslims in America -- Pritzker learned a lot about civil rights advocacy and leadership, such as the relationships between African-American activists and civil rights activists outside and inside government. However, his parents had already played a large role by instilling their values in Pritzker. `I've spent my whole life as an advocate expanding civil rights and individual rights because my parents were progressive Democrats and were involved in issues like fighting for women's rights,' Pritzker said. It's fitting that on World Diabetes Day, Illinois has taken bold action to protect our residents' health, rather than force them to use lower quality medication or even ration their supply. We are proud that Illinois continues to be a national leader in ensuring health care is a right and not a privilege. This important step forward for lowering health care costs is the result of the tireless advocacy of Sen. Andy Manar, Rep. Will Guzzardi and so many other champions. I look forward to signing this legislation and continuing my commitment to ensuring Illinois residents have access to comprehensive, high-quality and affordable health care coverage. The Rebuild Illinois plan transforms our state's approach to transportation infrastructure, finally treating our roads, bridges, and railways like 21st century investments and not relics of"
Q4806029," the effective action on the ground of Kurdish forces, which gives us the opportunity to support them tactically. And that's what we were doing over the weekend north of Raqqa, which is conducting airstrikes that limit [ IS' ] freedom of movement and ability to counter those capable Kurdish forces. And as it's very important, that's the manner in which effective and lasting defeat of [ IS ] will occur, when there are effective local forces on the ground that we can support and enable so that they can take territory, hold territory and make sure that good governance comes in behind it. So we are looking for those opportunities and trying to create those opportunities in Syria.... but it's the success on the ground of the Kurds that explains the uptick over the last few days. Let me turn to the execution of DoD's two lines of effort, beginning with the U.S.-led campaign of air strikes against ISIL [ ISIS ] in Iraq and Syria. This effort has produced some clear results - in limiting ISIL's freedom of movement, constraining its ability to reinforce its fighters, and impeding its command-and-control. It has enabled some key achievements for local forces - including the very recent success of anti-ISIL forces who took the key town of Tal Abyad. The strikes are also buying critical time and space to carry out DoD's second line of effort, which is developing the capacity and capabilities of legitimate local ground forces. I suppose it's also fair to say, statistically, that there are some other specialties in which women have historically excelled. You have to be careful about that, because it's sometimes a matter of where they felt they could advance rather than anything else. But women are represented differently across specialties that have long been open, and that's why I think that we really need to focus on standards as we go into implementation. And we're going to learn a lot, and we already have learned from service studies and surveys, about how to think about standards in the course of considering this matter of gender. Russia continues to violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, and actively seeks to intimidate its Baltic neighbors. At sea, in the air and space and cyberspace, Russian actors have engaged in challenging international norms. And most disturbing, Moscow's nuclear saber-rattling raises troubling questions about Russia's leaders' commitments to strategic stability, their respect for norms against the use of nuclear weapons, and whether they respect the profound caution that nuclear-age leaders showed with regard to the brandishing of nuclear weapons. We are working... but we have big ambitions. Jet engines, aircraft carrier technology are big projects that we're working very hard on. And some of the projects that we're launching just now are, in part, intended to blaze a trail for things to come. The projects were selected based on feedback from the US and Indian defence industries. The other thing to keep in mind is that the whole point is to make these industrially and economically successful projects. So, they're not things that can be dictated by the governments; we try to involve industry, We already see countries in the region trying to carve up these markets... forging many separate trade agreements in recent years, some based on pressure and special arrangements.... Agreements that..... leave us on the sidelines. That risks America's access to these growing markets. We must all decide if we are going to let that happen. If we're going to help boost our exports and our economy... and cement our influence and leadership in the fastest-growing region in the world; or if, instead, we're going to take ourselves out of the game, makes strong strategic sense, and it is probably one of the most important parts of the rebalance, and that's why it has won such bipartisan support. In fact, you may not expect to hear this from a Secretary of Defense, but in terms of our rebalance in the broadest sense, passing TPP is as important to me as another aircraft carrier. It would deepen our alliances and partnerships abroad and underscore our lasting commitment to the Asia-Pacific. And it would help us promote a global order that reflects both our interests and our values. When I was working on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, it was-even for assistance to our own forces-way too much red tape stood in the way. You had to constantly try to cut through that. I'm not familiar with the Jordanian circumstance, but I do read the newspapers, and I can well believe that it's slower than King Abdullah finds acceptable, and that you and I would find acceptable. If I'm confirmed as secretary of Defense, this is an area I'm pretty familiar with, and I'd work to get those things out there the way we did MRAPs. And so we need to think through what's the appropriate force protection posture for each one of those. But force protection and protecting those who protect us has to"
Q6176439," After reviewing country conditions and consulting with the appropriate U.S. government agencies, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson has determined that conditions in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone no longer support their designations for TPS. The widespread transmission of Ebola virus in the three countries that led to the designations has ended, no longer preventing nationals from returning in safety. To provide for an orderly transition, nationals of Liberia (and individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia) who have been granted TPS under the Liberia designation will automatically retain their TPS and have their current Employment Authorization Documents (EAD) extended through May 20, 2017. Beneficiaries do not need to pay a fee or file any application, including for work authorization, in order to retain their TPS benefits through May 20, 2017. Although TPS benefits will no longer be in effect starting May 21, 2017, TPS beneficiaries will continue to hold any other immigration status that they have maintained or acquired while registered for TPS. DHS urges individuals who do not have another immigration status to use the time before the termination becomes effective in May 2017 to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States or to apply for other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible On 9/11 I was here. My wife was visiting, a rare visit to Washington actually and 9/11 hit. She got the last rental car out of Enterprise out of Washington and drove straight home to be with our kids. And as she was driving on a lonely highway in Pennsylvania, Ohio Task Force 1 was coming the other way and lights were flashing and she recognized them. And they were driving into danger. I've known a lot of the men and women involved with that task force including men who went that day and made that trip who did go into harm's way. They deserve this protection. This protects their job when they get back and protects them from liability, it protects them from their insurance, its just common sense stuff. One, I want to thank the International Association of Firefighters, I want to thank FEMA and others who have endorsed this and supported this and helped us to move it. But let's get this done. We cannot wait until another Congress. FEMA actually came originally to this Congress about 10 years ago on this issue and said we wanted to codify it. So, Secretary Johnson, thanks for your support of it. I hope that we can move it forward. Do you have any comments on that, Secretary Johnson, this morning? Andrea, you are correct. As the secretary of Homeland Security, I have avoided responding to the political season and what candidates have said running for president. However, I believe that it's the responsibility of those of us in national security and homeland security when a leading candidate for office proposes something that is irresponsible, probably illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to international law, un-American, and will actually hurt our efforts at homeland security and national security, we have to speak out. So we're in an age right now that involves terrorists-inspired as well as terrorists-directed attack. The Islamic state has targeted the Muslim community. So it is all the more important that we reach out and build bridges to American Muslims, and American Muslim communities. We've been doing a lot of this lately. And it's important that we continue to do that working with the Muslim community, not driving them away, not vilifying them, not driving them into the shadows is absolutely critical to our national security efforts. So, those of us in government have to speak out about this proposal, this idea. I hope not. Very definitely, there is a rise in the levels of extremist violent behavior directed not just at people based on race. I think what is new is directed at people perceived to occupy a political ideology list. For example, this lieutenant's personal belongings included the list, much like the pipe bomber that was arrested. And that is new. And so without policing speech, without policing thought in a free and open democratic society, traditional law enforcement and in efforts of building bridges in communities needs to continue. This is truly a difficult nut to crack. And the levels of hatred and violence we see are going up. The ADL points out anti-Semitism is going up now. It has to start at the top. Leaders lead, and people really do listen to their leaders. And the level of dialogue is deviating downward, the civility of our dialogue is deviating downward such that individuals like this Coast Guard lieutenant feel emboldened and perhaps even initialed to take matters into his own hands and carry out acts of violence. Illegal migration reacts sharply to perceived changes in enforcement policy, in the short term. But it always reverts back, longer-term, to the longer-term trends, given the underlying conditions, the so-called "
Q16255546," We released it in response to requests by several parties for more detail on the assumptions in those scenarios regarding broadcaster participation, and on the specific markets that would be affected if the auction system assigned stations to the duplex gap. I made the decision to provide it publicly and to all, while simultaneously suspending the sunshine rules so that commenters could provide input. The purpose of releasing the data was to demonstrate to broadcasters and the unlicensed community the de minimis impact of the duplex gap option at multiple levels of licensee participation. It is worth noting that the full Commission sought comment on whether the auction system should be able to assign stations to the duplex gap in December 2014, asking specifically about this point as part of our release of proposed auction procedures. In the coming weeks, I intend to conclude this open item with a Report and Order that will buttress AM broadcast service and ease regulatory burdens on AM broadcasters. The proposed Order would adopt specific measures to addressfccnew practical problems and interference-related issues that have long plagued AM stations across the country. If adopted, these measures will enable AM stations to operate more efficiently in today's spectrum environment. For example, the proposed Order would give stations more flexibility in choosing site locations, complying with local zoning requirements, obtaining power increases, and incorporating energy-efficient technologies. These actions will help to ease some of the technical limitations that have hindered AM stations in serving their listeners. Let's look back at those 3-2 votes. They created a fast, fair, and open internet that has expanded broadband penetration, that has expanded investment in services over the internet, that has expanded fiber, that has resulted in increased revenues for those being regulated. They resulted in privacy for Americans, so that the same thing they expect from their telephone they get when they go on the Web from their networks. The 3-2 votes expanded services to schools, expanded broadband to low-income Americans, provided that prisoners -- for a 15-minute call with their kid -- didn't have to pay what you and I have to pay for a month's worth of cellular service... I'm surprised that those kinds of things are 3-2 votes. I think that those kinds of things are important principles. This week, I will circulate to the members of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed new rules to preserve the internet as an open platform for innovation and free expression. This proposal is rooted in long-standing regulatory principles, marketplace experience, and public input received over the last several months. Broadband network operators have an understandable motivation to manage their network to maximize their business interests. But their actions may not always be optimal for network users. The Congress gave the FCC broad authority to update its rules to reflect changes in technology and marketplace behavior in a way that protects consumers. Over the years, the Commission has used this authority to the public's great benefit. Serving as F.C.C. Chairman during this period of historic technological change has been the greatest honor of my professional life. I am deeply grateful to the President for giving me this opportunity. I am especially thankful to the talented Commission staff for their service and sacrifice during my tenure. Their achievements have contributed to a thriving communications sector, where robust investment and world-leading innovation continue to drive our economy and meaningful improvements in the lives of the American people. It has been a privilege to work with my fellow Commissioners to help protect consumers, strengthen public safety and cybersecurity, and ensure fast, fair and open networks for all Americans. the reality is that you invest in order to get a return. We're in a period right now where we're seeing record revenues for the ISPs, an increase in the amount of investment... One of the things I've always found interesting is that the companies would come to see us and they would talk about all the things going to happen and they would go over to the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, where not telling the truth is a punishable offense. And they would file at the SEC, for instance, AT&T has filed recently `We intend to spend 15% of our revenue on investment every year.' They didn't say `except for the fact that we're going to have to cut it back because of those awful internet rules. ' the United States the first country in the world to identify and open up vast amounts of high frequency spectrum for 5G applications. The big game-changer is that we are using much higher-frequency bands than previously thought viable for flexible uses, including mobile. The ability to use this high-frequency spectrum opens much bigger chunks of spectrum. Current blocks of licensed "
Q3317069," What's happening now on the streets of America is mayors every day are dealing with this particular issue, and it is critically important. Now, not all the time when people just start, you know, a movement does, is there a political consequence right after. But we've been in this moment for a very, very long time. And on the issues of immigration, gun violence, discrimination, as you were talking about earlier about transgender individuals who are willing to sacrifice their lives for our nation and still being discriminated against. The overarching message from the book and all the things we're seeing is you have got to stop discriminating against people. You have to be open. You have to keep people safe. And you have to keep working hard. We're going to keep banging on this wall until the wall falls. And I think this movement that's now started with responsible gun ownership, trying to find a way to keep our folks safe, treating violence not just like a public safety issue, but a public health issue is an issue that's beginning to resonate. We have to get Congress to respond and state legislatures as well, that have the hands of mayors tied. New Orleans was America's largest slave market: a port where hundreds of thousands of souls were bought, sold and shipped up the Mississippi River to lives of forced labor of misery of rape, of torture. America was the place where nearly 4,000 of our fellow citizens were lynched, 540 alone in Louisiana, where the courts enshrined `separate but equal,' where Freedom riders coming to New Orleans were beaten to a bloody pulp. So when people say to me that the monuments in question are history, well what I just described is real history as well, and it is the searing truth. And it immediately begs the questions, why there are no slave ship monuments, no prominent markers on public land to remember the lynchings or the slave blocks; nothing to remember this long chapter of our lives; the pain, the sacrifice, the shame, all of it happening on the soil of New Orleans. So for those self-appointed defenders of history and the monuments, they are eerily silent on what amounts to this historical malfeasance, a lie by omission. There is a difference between remembrance of history and reverence of it. These statues are not just stone and metal. They are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history. These monuments purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy; ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, and the terror that it actually stood for. After the Civil War, these statues were a part of that terrorism as much as a burning cross on someone's lawn; they were erected purposefully to send a strong message to all who walked in their shadows about who was still in charge in this city. [... ] [ A ] friend asked me to consider these four monuments from the perspective of an African-American mother or father trying to explain to their fifth-grade daughter who Robert E. Lee is and why he stands atop of our beautiful city. Can you do it? Can you look into that young girl's eyes and convince her that Robert E. Lee is there to encourage her? Do you think she will feel inspired and hopeful by that story? Do these monuments help her see a future with limitless potential? Have you ever thought that if her potential is limited, yours and mine are too? These solar-powered compactors will ensure cleaner streets in high-traffic areas throughout the city, particularly in the French Quarter and Downtown Development District.

This Is Exactly What Louisiana Needs, Yet Another Dedicated Fund In The Budget Sheriff Marlin Gusman won't turn over jail records, Justice Department, inmate advocates say Louisiana towns appears more on list of 50 most affordable small towns in U.S. than any other state, website reports `FOREVER AGREEMENT' ? WH: Iran deal `long-term' despite expiration dates Sheriff Marlin Gusman won't turn over jail records, Justice Department, inmate advocates say We lost 1,800 fellow Americans, and the devastation we experienced was great. But in the wake of that tragedy, we witnessed unbelievable acts of heroism and compassion from across this great country and the world. No city welcomed more New Orleanians following Katrina than Houston, and our hearts break for them as Hurricane Harvey displaces so many of their citizens. As they and others around the world were our refuge in a time of trouble, we will observe this somber anniversary by praying for our fellow Americans who are in need, and we will do all we can to help them stand back up.

Q6289368," Earlier today, more than a dozen Attorneys General and I filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's decision to end the successful DACA program that the Federal Government started five years ago. I have reviewed the President's actions and determined they violate the rule of law. I'm forced to act because of a failure in leadership, both by President Trump and by Congress to fix our broken immigration system. 800,000 young people, including 5,889 Pennsylvanians, were brought to our country as babies, infants and young children in the care of their parents. They grew up in America and for many, this is their only home. The Federal Government introduced a program, called, DACA, and asked these young people to register. They pad a $495 fee, passed background checks, submitted personal information including their fingerprints and home address, and obeyed our laws as adults. They go through this process every two years. In exchange, they went to school and went to work for our country. They paid taxes -- and don't receive federal benefits such as welfare and food stamps. They bought their first homes. They joins our military. The 5,889 recipients here in Pennsylvania are contributing to our Commonwealth -- 87 percent are employed. They generate over $20 million in state and local taxes. Whether or not you agree with the policy or support President Trump isn't the issue here. The Federal Government made a promise, they put a program in place and asked these young people who have grown up as Americans to apply, and the rule of law says we can't rip that away from them now. Make no mistake -- our immigration laws are a disgrace. President Trump and Congress owe the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the American people enforceable immigration laws that make us safe and create jobs. Washington has debated this issue and done nothing for fifteen years. It's shameful. Our lawsuit lays out a series of concerns, from making sure the Federal Government doesn't use the information provided by DREAMers against them to the economic harm done to our Commonwealth. If the Administration addresses these concerns and modifies their order, I'll be the first to commend them. But the Administration cannot violate the rule of law as we wait for Congress to do their job and that's why I'm taking legal action today. The 37th statewide grand jury investigating clergy sex abuse in the Johnstown/Altoona Diocese called for abolishing the criminal statute of limitations for sex crimes against children. I renew that call again, here, today in Erie. I believe it is long past time to reform these arbitrary, arbitrary timeframes so that we can seek justice for all of our children. There is no statute of limitations on homicide under Pennsylvania law and there shouldn't be on child abuse either. I just explained that in this case in the Diocese of Erie our investigators uncovered additional evidence of other sexual assaults but the statute of limitations prohibits us from filing those additional charges. These victims and all victims are entitled to justice and the statute of limitations should not be a bar toward receiving that justice. I'm asking the Pennsylvania legislature and Governor Wolf to, again, abolish this statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse. This afternoon a four-member majority of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that it could not decide the scope of the modification provisions in the Consent Decrees without an evidentiary record and therefore remanded the case to the Commonwealth Court for an expedited hearing. Three justices, in dissent, indicated that they had no problem holding that the modification clause cannot accommodate what the OAG is trying to do. None of the justices, notably, accepted the OAG's position that the modification clause was unlimited, deciding this issue was a matter for Commonwealth Court to resolve after receiving additional evidence. Importantly, all the justices agreed that it was not necessary for them to extend the termination date of the Consent Decrees through their extraordinary powers. In November 2016, Uber learned that hackers had gained access to some personal information Uber maintains about its drivers, including drivers' license information for about 600,000 drivers nationwide. Instead of reporting the breach to law enforcement and impacted individuals, Uber tracked down the hackers and obtained assurances that the hackers deleted the information -- and made payments to ensure their silence... Since some of the compromised information -- specifically driver's license numbers -- is considered personally identifiable information (PII), Uber was required to notify impacted individuals under the Pennsylvania Breach of Personal Information Notification Act. However, Uber failed to report the breach until November 2017.

I think he's being exactly who he said he was going to be. And I think everybody should respect someone who says they're going to do something and does it. Whether you like what they do or not is a totally different story. I think he's not being nearly as innovative on some of the major issues we need, like health care. I do think he should look at some of the waiver states and see what they've done because frankly, there's two choices. You either get the taxpayers to subsidize Medicaid across the board and make them all in a risk pool where everybody pays high premiums or do you do what the other states have done giving the taxpayers a break, not taking their taxes down because our taxes are still going into those federal subsidies, but at least their premiums are going down so that there's more money in their pocket. I think some of those things on health care, especially since he's shown to be somebody who has a great interest in health care, I think he may have, claimed to be an expert in some categories. I'd like to see him do a lot more with that than he's done, but in general, I can't fault him for going in the direction he said he was going to go in, because he got elected and that's what his integrity should take him to do.

Q5387459," The FCC's vote to rip apart net neutrality is a blow to New York consumers, and to everyone who cares about a free and open internet. The FCC just gave Big Telecom an early Christmas present, by giving internet service providers yet another way to put corporate profits over consumers. Today's rollback will give ISPs new ways to control what we see, what we do, and what we say online. That's a threat to the free exchange of ideas that's made the Internet a valuable asset in our democratic process. Today's new rule would enable ISPs to charge consumers more to access sites like Facebook and Twitter and give them the leverage to degrade high quality of video streaming until and unless somebody pays them more money. Even worse, today's vote would enable ISPs to favor certain viewpoints over others. New Yorkers deserve the right to a free and open Internet. That's why we will sue to stop the FCC's illegal rollback of net neutrality. Today's vote also follows a public comment process that was deeply corrupted, including two million comments that stole the identities of real people. This is a crime under New York law -- and the FCC's decision to go ahead with the vote makes a mockery of government integrity and rewards the very perpetrators who scammed the system to advance their own agenda. This is not just an attack on the future of our internet. It's an attack on all New Yorkers, and on the integrity of every American's voice in government -- and we will fight back.

We strongly oppose President Trump's action today that undermines Clean Water Act protections and the public health and environment of our states. The President's order runs counter to the Clean Water Act's, and the EPA's, very purpose: achieving clean water. The Clean Water Rule is a measured, reasonable, and lawful application of sound and uncontroverted science to protect our nation's upstream source waters. We rely on these waters to ensure clean drinking water, recreation, and viable commercial fishing and navigation. Abandoning the Clean Water Rule will allow uncontrolled pollution of these critical water resources. It could also harm the competitiveness of our state economies by forcing us to spend more to clean up the pollution of deregulated waters coming from upstream states that refuse to control such pollution. Clean water is essential to life -- and the people of our states and the nation deserve the basic protections established by the Clean Water Rule, to ensure that the benefits of clean water are shared equally, regardless of state lines. We won't hesitate to protect our people and our environment -- including by aggressively opposing in court President Trump's actions that ignore both the law and the public's paramount need for clean water. The passing of Representative Slaughter is a tremendous loss for the City of Rochester, and all New Yorkers. Born the daughter of a blacksmith, she never lost her Kentucky accent, but she rose to become an icon in Western New York. She got her political start as an activist trying to protect the Hart's Woods from development, and although she wasn't successful in that endeavor, she never gave up fighting for what she believed in, from the County Legislature, to the State Assembly to the halls of Congress. Despite the sexism she faced while running for office as a woman and as the mother of young children, she prevailed, and rose to become the first woman chair of the powerful House Rules Committee. As an influential voice for women in our nation's capital, she coauthored the landmark Violence Against Women Act, among other critical legislation.

Q529351," Wow. I am not even going to go into facilities, I'm not going to go into what is going on with mental health, I'm not going to go into what is the problem with drugs. I will tell you that with the previous IHS staff I remember giving a speech similar to what the chairman did and that is that if you guys don't advocate for a budget how the hell are we supposed to fix it. I have never had, in ten years on this committee, I have never had somebody come up here and when I ask them a direct question they don't answer it. I asked you a direct question on whether this budget was up or down and you would not answer it, you refused to answer it. That is totally unacceptable. I did not come in here with my hair on fire, but I am leaving here with it. I am going to tell you something, Indian health services is in a crisis and if you have served in Indian Health services for ten years and you have answered the questions in Indian health service like you have here today, there is no wonder it is in a crisis. I cannot believe what has transpired in this hearing today. All I want are some damn answers, that's it. And if we cannot get answers from Indian health where do we go to get those answers? I don't expect you to answer that either. This is an unbelievable hearing, I just got to tell you I have not had one like this in my tenure in here. When I ask a question, I want an answer. It's unbelievable. Because the conversation hasn't gone away, it continues to resurface in different forms in Washington, DC, and you continue to be concerned that if these folks are able to either de-fund a lot of these agencies so they can't do the work, to make sure it's there, or make it so people don't have access to it, and people get upset and say, `enough of this.' What I'm saying to you is, I think you can see an agenda that's starting to form back there, and the end results of that would be dissatisfaction with public lands, and so now the government's going to get rid of them. Eric Whitney: You talk about `these folks' that have that agenda to privatize public lands. Does that include specific people or groups in Montana? Or members of Montana's congressional delegation? The Department of Interior has repeatedly acknowledged that it broke the law by issuing these leases without consulting with the tribe and conducting sufficient environmental review. Interior is appealing the Solenex case to protect its decision to cancel all outstanding leases in the Badger-Two Medicine. Do you still believe that, as you stated in 2015, `This is something the tribe cannot stop?' Do you believe that, despite the irreversible and drastic harm posed to the Blackfeet tribe and the self-confessed illegal actions taken by the Interior Department, that Solenex should be allowed to drill on this sacred land? Do you commit to recusing yourself from any decision relating to the Badger-Two Medicine area? Okay, because I think is it absolutely unbelievable that you can't separate how much money Medicaid has helped you with third party billing. I mean, to the point where I think we should almost demand an audit. Because, that's not how things work and you should have those numbers on the tip of your tongue, to be honest with you. If we are going to make policy here we have to figure out what the impacts of that policy is going to be, and by the way it is your agency that deals with Indian health; Indian health and nothing else. So we have to have it and I don't mean to lecture to you, but have you had a chance to do an assessment of what the needs are during your three weeks at IHS? At a time when our country is so divided across party lines, we need more leaders committed to putting aside these differences to confront our greatest challenges. Evan Bayh's record as Indiana's Governor and U.S. Senator reflects this very commitment. A bipartisan problem-solver, Evan has always put Hoosiers first -- striving to make Indiana all the better, whether it was working to cut taxes or steadily increasing funding for K-12 and expanding access to higher education. Evan has once again shown his commitment to the people he's served by stepping forward to make sure middle class Hoosiers have a true voice in the Senate. We look forward to working to elect him this fall. Last week, the Secretary of the Air Force announced that cleanup operations at Tyndall Air Force Base were being impacted by a shortfall in funding. We are dismayed that the Department has chosen to prioritize a political campaign promise over the disaster relief needs of our service members, given the finite reprogramming authority available. We remind you that we continue to work diligently on a supplemental appropriations bill that will provide relief to all Americans impacted by natural disasters, despite the fact that the President of the United States has requested no emergency funding to address the current needs for hurricane and flood relief. After no public input, this bill emerged from the shadows, "
Q5562913," The Governor has thus far stonewalled on releasing her own authorized truck diversion study, but in the wake of a survey recently released by the RI Trucking Association (conducted by the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association), StopTollsRI.com believes the release of the state sponsored survey is urgent. Representative Patricia Morgan, a staunch critic of the truck tolls plan, submitted an APRA request to see the diversion study and it was originally denied, along with her request for toll gantry locations. After significant public pressure, the Raimondo administration last week provided the toll gantry locations, but this important study, which covered likely diversion routes truckers could use to avoid the tolls, remains inaccessible to the public. StopTollsRI.com believes the Governor's motivation in refusing to release all of the data is due to findings that would indicate there would be a significant amount of diversion around the toll gantries. Without access to considerably more information than I have right now, I can't say whether Brown's proposal with Prospect would be better for Rhode Island than a purchase of CNE by Partners, either for the state economically, or, more importantly in my view, in terms of Rhode Islanders' access to effective and affordable health care. That access to effective and affordable health care, for everyone, is what is of critical importance in today's complex healthcare environment. Ultimately, CNE will or will not reach a deal with Partners. If they do, the Department of Health (and the Attorney General's Office) will gather a great deal of information as they evaluate what is best for Rhode Islanders under the relevant criteria of the Hospital Conversions Act. That evaluation presumably will address many if not all of the concerns Brown raised today, After being out of state for the past four days, I heard the full extent of Joe DeLorenzo's comments on the John DePetro Show, and I was deeply bothered by them. This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. It is not a progressive or a conservative issue. It is about recognizing that women face many more challenges in the workplace than we do as men. I am the father of three daughters, and speaking with them, they've told me about their experiences and the challenges they've faced, and it truly troubles me to hear their stories. I believe he showed a lack of understanding of what women are experiencing in the workplace. Our party stands for sensitivity, equality, and respect. If he truly believes what he said, then I suggest he step down. A state budget is more than just a spreadsheet. It's a statement on our values. As Rhode Islanders, we value opportunity, education and community. Because of the choices we've made together, our economy is stronger today than it's been in a generation. We've made a lot of progress in recent years, and we need to keep going to ensure that everyone is included. Together, we're going to fix our kids' school buildings, ensure everyone has a shot to compete for a good job and protect the most vulnerable people in our state, including Rhode Islanders with disabilities, young people in foster care and our seniors. This budget protects the progress we've made and reflects the values we share. I thank the legislature for their hard work. and we did roll it out poorly and I've taken ownership for that. There was mistakes made. And we have stuck by it to turn the corner. You know, there's always going to be mistakes, any time you do anything, but let's look at what we've accomplished. For the first time in decades, we're fixing our roads, we're fixing our bridges. Outside your window, if we could look out the window here, you'd see a few cranes in the sky. The unemployment numbers are out -- Rhode Island has the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 20 years. We've cut taxes every year, I've cut the deficit every year. The facts are the facts, Rhode Island's on the move, and if Mayor Fung's elected governor, he's going to throw us and our economy into reverse. It was a serious and troubling mistake and the Board of Elections ran a process, and he has acknowledged his mistake. I think the important here is, people need to have confidence in their public leaders. We all need to follow the rules. There's rules, we all need to follow the rules. If you break the rules, then there are consequences. I will say every year since I've been governor I have been working to tighten campaign finance laws and ethics laws. I have a bill before the legislature right now to tighten campaign finance laws and to call for random audits [ of campaign finance accounts ]. And I hope that they pass it, because again people deserve to have confidence in public leaders. The President is endangering the health of nearly all coastal waters in our country, including our 400 miles of coastline in Rhode Island, so that rich oil companies can get richer.

Q3466996," [ W ] hen I hear Michael Cohen, through these sources, say that Donald Trump knew about the meeting, that's like telling us that the sun sets in the west. We always knew that Donald Trump knew about the meeting. Because all of the evidence suggested that. He was very close with the family that had asked Donald Trump Jr. to set up the meeting. He was one floor above where the meeting took place. Donald Trump, Jr. and his father talked about Donald Trump, Jr.'s work on behalf of the campaign throughout... the campaign. And of course, there were the actions Donald Trump took after the meeting was exposed in his efforts to try and cover up the meeting by trying to dictate the statement that Donald Trump, Jr. gave to the press. So, it's not really a surprise, but now is the time for Michael Cohen to cooperate with Bob Mueller. And if this was a real investigation on the House side, we would be bringing Michael Cohen and Donald Trump, Jr. back in. But, unfortunately, the Republicans prematurely and irresponsibly ended our investigation. Yesterday we saw in our committee I believe the most aggressive effort by the white house to obstruct our effort to get the truth. Steve Bannon claimed that the White House is asserting three privileges. One, that he cannot talk about anything that occurred during the transition. That has never been upheld or asserted before. Two, that he can't talk about anything during his time with the executive branch. Now, there are some privileges that exist there, but they took it as far to mean if he had a drink at a bar and talked to a friend about anything in the world, we couldn't ask him about that. And then third, the most stunning assertion was that even once Steve Bannon left the white house in August of 2017, any conversations he had with the president that he was asked about that he could not relay what he had said. And so it's quite concerning, we're a nation -- we have a rule of law and the White House is seeking to muzzle witnesses. It is, Katy. He's governing the wrong country. He's obstructing an investigation into his campaign where he is potentially a suspect. The consequences, of course, are removal from office. We're not helpless here. What we should do is make sure that our House Intelligence Committee fully investigates what happened with the Russians, and now, any other country that sought to help him. And also, the House Judiciary Committee, the other committee I sit on, should be able to look into, not just his conduct here, but other concerning and alarming conduct, like cashing in on the Oval Office and the transactions he's doing with the Chinese, where he's taking loans on his properties and then giving away jobs for American workers. So, we're not helpless. It's going to take courage, though, from Republicans and Democrats to hold him accountable. I don't think that price is going to be paid until November. We need friends in the world. Today, if there was to be an attack on America or one of the America's interesting, I'm not sure we would have the same friends across the world lining up to go to conflict or to help defend the United States. The Danish, for example, they went with us into the last two conflicts. Whether you agreed with the conflicts or not, in Iraq and Afghanistan, they served side by side with American soldiers. We continue to alienate our friends. Also, as you look at the programs in Europe, where they take care of people through health care, education, access to skills, they don't spend as much on defense. I think it's an opportunity for us to realize we can have strength through partnerships, spend less on defense at home. But if he's going to alienate us, we'll have to spend more on our national defense, and that's at the cost of education and health care. I have written legislation, Ali, that would tighten up the emoluments clause. The courts are allowing a lawsuit Senator Blumenthal have brought forward and I and other plaintiffs to go forward. I have legislation that would prevent the president and the vice-president or anyone in their family from benefiting financially at all during their tenure in the white house, from any foreign national investment. So there's a lot we can do. Also, Ali, let me say, I thought over the last 48 hours that maybe the president was parroting the Saudis. But now that I start to listen to the president's defense, I wonder if they are parroting him, because they are sounding a lot like what he said about the trump tower meeting. He didn't know the meeting took place. And so it sounds like this is just kind of his strategy of deny, deny, deny, and he's projecting that onto the Saudis. We have the candidates for it to be a tsunami. I met many of them, about 60 of them are under the age of 40. They're veterans, small business owners, doctors, many women who have stepped up, 18 months ago never imagined they'd be running for Congress. They see a wrecking ball president and they're inspired to help their commun"
Q6133660," Yesterday, I watched in disbelief as hundreds of Americans gathered to present a hateful vision of our nation that shuts out rather than includes others. They chanted white supremacist slogans and sought, successfully, to kill those who disagreed with them. To call them anything other than neo Nazis and white supremacists would be a disservice. It would also be dangerous. In another era, we could look to the highest office in the land decry this hatred and denounce a cowardice act of senseless violence. We might expect that our president, led by a strong moral compass and inspired by a responsibility to represent all Americans, would offer words to help heal rather than divide our country. But we do not live in that age and so that duty falls on all of us. Since President Trump began his campaign, Philadelphians have marched, donated and put signs on your lawns and windows. I thank them for embracing a vision of our nation that is rooted in love and unity, not hatred. Now more than ever, we have to actively work to create the American future we want -- a future that is diverse and inclusive of different people and ideas. And one in which we acknowledge that hatred based on ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation is not a different political viewpoint -- and it is not justified by economics. So, I ask Philadelphians to stay peaceful but to remain engaged. Volunteer in a rec center or school outside of your neighborhood. Become a foster parent. Respect the first amendment rights of your neighbors, but do not hesitate to call out bigotry whenever you see it. Together, these small actions can help create the true intercultural unity that many of us believed we had achieved until the Trump presidency jolted us into reality. All of us have a responsibility to create the future we want. Just saying we oppose something is no longer enough -- we have to remind people what we stand for, and work together thoughtfully and compassionately to make it a reality. One hundred years ago, civic and political leaders set out to achieve a bold vision, to construct a new art museum building that would increase the visibility of the city and secure its place in the world. And when this new building was completed in 1928, our city received both a cultural heart and a source of civic pride. Now, a new generation of Philadelphians will be able to enjoy this architectural treasure. This museum welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors from across the region, country, and world. In a given five-year period, this level of activity has an economic impact on the local economy of more than $1 billion and generates over $80 million in tax revenue. The completion of this project is likely to make those numbers grow. This project is not just vital to the institution, but also to Philadelphia. I frequently speak about the impact public-private partnerships have on Philadelphia and its residents. This Museum's formation is a shining example of that. And that continues today; I am proud to announce that my Administration has committed $32.5 million of capital support over the next six years to help fund the Core Project. It's got to be investigated and we've got to find these people and lock them up. President Trump also tweeted his denunciation of hate crimes, sending a clear message that his administration and this country stand united in opposing the vicious acts.

For many, Starbucks is not just a place to buy a cup of coffee, but a place to meet up with friends or family members, or to get some work done. Like all retail establishments in our city, Starbucks should be a place where everyone is treated the same, no matter the color of their skin. Commissioner Ross and his team have promised a review of their policies moving forward with regards to response to complaints like this. I believe a thorough review is fully warranted given the unfortunate outcome of this event, particularly at a time when our criminal justice reform efforts are focused on avoiding needless incarcerations. Two courts have now considered the arguments of the beverage industry and b"
Q16205062," Over the past three weeks, a group called the Center for Medical Progress has released online videos that claim to show evidence of the illegal sale of fetal tissue by certain Planned Parenthood chapters around the nation. My office was asked to review the practices of Planned Parenthood in Massachusetts to ensure that their practices conform to state and federal law. Over the past week, my office has conducted a thorough review and found that Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts' health care centers are fully compliant with state and federal laws regarding the disposition of fetal tissue. Although donation of fetal tissue is permissible under state and federal law, PPLM does not have a tissue donation program. There is no evidence that PPLM is involved in any way in the buying or selling of tissue. As such, our review is complete. Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts provides basic health care services to 50,000 Massachusetts patients a year, including low-income women and families. They offer cancer screenings, HIV testing, and birth control. I believe strongly in the mission of Planned Parenthood, and am proud of the work they have done to help ensure the safe access to health care when and where women need it. I will fight to support Planned Parenthood and preserve the essential health services that they provide to so many women. I urge everyone who cares about these issues to do the same. The investigation found that the stolen credentials were used to exploit weaknesses in Target's system, which allowed the attackers to access a customer service database, install malware on the system and then capture data from credit or debit card transactions at Target stores (including stores in Massachusetts) from Nov. 27, 2013 to Dec. 15, 2013. The stolen data included consumers' full names, telephone numbers, email addresses, mailing addresses, payment card numbers, expiration dates, security codes, and encrypted debit PINs... The breach affected more than 41 million customer payment card accounts and contact information for more than 60 million customers nationwide. In Massachusetts, the breach compromised information from approximately 947,000 customer payment card accounts and other personally-identifying information of about 1.5 million Massachusetts residents. Marty Walsh has been a tireless advocate for the people of Boston, has led our city with his head and heart for four years and is a critical partner in all of our work fighting for progress here, throughout Massachusetts and across the nation. Our shared values are under attack like never before in America and, where Congress and Washington fail, states and cities must lead Marty Walsh knows that, lives that and has been true to that his entire career. Under Mayor Walsh, Boston has remained a place where all Bostonians have a shot, whether they're born in Port-au-Prince or Jamaica Plain, and I'm enthusiastically supporting the Mayor because I know that over the next four years, he'll always be there, fighting with and for us all day, every day. The Attorney General's Office has long advocated for increased safety standards at the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station. My primary concern now is that Entergy initiates a safe and orderly closure of the Pilgrim plant, and that it invests the proper resources to do so. I'm concerned as well that measures are in place to support workers. Today's announcement also highlights the need for a long-term federal solution to the storage of spent nuclear fuel at the facility and across the country. I am as convinced as ever that the solution to our long-term energy needs must include a broad portfolio of sources that meets our environmental, jobs and cost goals for all residents. I tried to keep up with her for two days, and failed. Somewhere into the second day, a staffer asked if I was exhausted yet. (For the record: Yes, and my feet were killing me.) Healey's workday is jammed with events and appearances; she walks briskly up and down stairs in her 2-inch pumps (she says she needs the exercise), through parking garages, around halls jammed with people who want her ear. In between, she confers with staff -- and, of course, manages the top law office in the state. But her smile reveals no impatience, no indication that this or that delay will -- and, inevitably, it will -- jam up the rest of her day. Having spent more than a decade building natural gas electric generators to replace coal and oil facilities and reduce carbon emissions, the state has been forced to burn coal and oil in recent winters due to inadequate natural gas supplies. Given the severe constraints on pipeline capacity, this pattern will likely repeat itself this winter and in the future. This approach will not only deny relief to Massachusetts residents, businesses and industries burdened by sky-high energy costs, but also contribute to higher carbon emissions and make it more difficult to meet the goals of the state's Global Warming Act.

Q6669880," When the incident first occurred involving Larry Baer and his wife, the San Francisco Police Department immediately began an investigation. That investigation is ongoing, but regardless of the outcome, Major League Baseball needs to send a message that any and all acts of violence against women is unacceptable. The letter written by several respected women leaders in our domestic violence community echoes an all too familiar reality where incidents involving violence against women are not met with true accountability. While Mr. Baer has apologized and expressed remorse for his behavior, it does not excuse his actions and it does not erase what transpired. Mr. Baer's actions were serious and wrong. We are a City that loves and supports our San Francisco Giants, and that means holding our organization and its leaders to the highest of standards. Every little girl, every woman should be able to attend a Giants game with a clear sense of the organization's values. I share in the call to action by the women who have written the Commissioner calling for greater accountability. There must be a stronger public reaction and response to violence against women in our City and our country. My response is, why are we still listening to the President? I mean, the fact is we here in our city, throughout states in the United States of America, we have demonstrated sadly that we've had to jump into action and make this work without federal government support. I mean, even here in San Francisco, we've had private companies go out and get masks and (personal protective equipment) in general to support our health-care workers. We've had to basically be innovative and work with the private sector to try and get the resources we need in order to make sure public health was protected. The federal government just isn't moving fast enough. I know the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, is busting her butt in Congress to try and get us the package that we need that's going to actually help workers and not necessarily corporations. But you know what? We don't have time to waste. Lives are in jeopardy. I mean, look what happened in New York. San Francisco is at 152 cases as of today. So we don't have time to mess around. I am saddened by Phyllis Lyon's passing. She was a true champion of LGBTQ rights and San Francisco was incredibly lucky to have her leadership and activism. Phyllis changed countless lives for the better. She was at the forefront of the LGBTQ rights movement -- fighting for a world in which people can marry who they love and live without fear of discrimination. Through decades of organizing, activism, and writing, Phyllis helped advance civil rights protections, created robust support networks for LGBTQ people, and established political and advocacy organizations that continue her work to this day. Importantly, Phyllis was a symbol of hope and courage for San Franciscans and people around the world. We know that there is still more work to be done to carry forward Phyllis's legacy of civil rights, and we will continue her fight. My thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends during this difficult time. It is with a heavy heart that write to you today to submit my resignation as a member of the San Francisco Airport Commission. I have served in this capacity for more than 20 years, through several administrations, and it would have been my honor and pleasure to continue to serve the City and the institution that I love for the foreseeable future. However, as you know, I have been struggling with multiple, severe medical conditions for several years, and they have worsened, forcing me to spend more and more time receiving treatment. The bottom line is, the demands of my medical treatment have increased to the point that I cannot continue to serve on the Commission. Therefore, I offer you my resignation, and wish you and the staff of the Airport, and my fellow commissioners, every success as you continue to lead the world's greatest city and its world-class airport. will secure and refurbish the new building and create a long-term financial foundation for SFGMC with a permanent endowment. To date, more than $9 million has been raised, with leadership gifts of $5 million from founding Chorus member Terrence Chan, $1 million from the Chorus Board of Directors, and $1 million from Zendesk Founder and CEO Mikkel Svane, along with $250,000 from the city of San Francisco and $500,000 from the state of California. The remaining $6 million will be raised through the generous support of individuals, foundations and businesses. Naming opportunities for iconic spaces within the new building include the auditorium, production studio, main lobby, second and third floor lobbies, conference rooms, offices, dressing rooms, the roof, and the building itself. I am saddened to announce that San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi passed away tonight. My heart goes out to his wife, Matsuko, his daughter, Lauren, and all his frie"
Q319084," A couple of days later I had a sit-down interview with a Minnesota print reporter who had interviewed me a number of times before. I have no recollection of the actual content of the interview, but I distinctly remember the thrill of using a new skill. Right out of the box, I pivoted to avoid answering a perfectly valid question so I could instead talk about whatever it was I was supposed to talk about that day. And the reporter seemed just fine with it! So I did it again on the second question. Again, the reporter seemed to have absolutely no problem. On the next question, just for the hell of it, I really overdid it, pivoting gratuitously. Again, I completely got away with it. The rest of the interview involved a string of egregious pivots followed by hammering home some point or other. When the interview ended, the veteran reporter turned to (Franken's communications people). `Hey, he's getting a lot of better!' he said with a smile. `I think he's got a real shot! CNN has just published a story, and I'm telling you this about a news story that has just been published, so I'm not expecting you to know whether or not it's true or not, but CNN just published a story alleging that the intelligence community provided documents to the president elect last week that included information that `Russian operatives claimed to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.' These documents also allegedly say `There was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.' Now again I am telling you this as it's coming out so, ah, you know. But if it's true it's obviously extremely serious, and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign what will you do? CNN has just published a story, and I'm telling you this about a news story that has just been published, so I'm not expecting you to know whether or not it's true or not, but CNN just published a story alleging that the intelligence community provided documents to the president-elect last week that included information that `Russian operatives claimed to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.' These documents also allegedly say `There was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.' Now again I am telling you this as it's coming out so, ah, you know. But if it's true it's obviously extremely serious, and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign what will you do? Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, we've cut the rate of uninsured Minnesotans in half, people no longer have to worry about being denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition, and people no longer have to worry about being dropped from their coverage when they get sick. We need to protect these and other important gains we've made, but we must do more to help those who are still struggling to afford coverage. I pushed for a public option during ACA negotiations because I strongly believed then -- as I do now -- that a robust public option is one of the best ways to bring down costs, hold insurance companies accountable, and protect health coverage for Minnesotans. As a member of the Senate Health Committee, I'm going to fight to move the public option forward, and I'll keep working ensure that the Affordable Care Act serves the best interests of Minnesota. This is a book about an unlikely campaign that had an even more improbable ending: the closest outcome in history and an unprecedented eight-month recount saga, which is pretty funny in retrospect. It's a book about what happens when the nation's foremost progressive satirist gets a chance to serve in the United States Senate and, defying the low expectations of the pundit class, actually turns out to be good at it. It's a book about our deeply polarized, frequently depressing, occasionally inspiring political culture, written from inside the belly of the beast. In this candid personal memoir, the honorable gentleman from Minnesota takes his army of loyal fans along with him from Saturday Night Live to the campaign trail, inside the halls of Congress, and behind the scenes of some of the most dramatic and/or hilarious moments of his new career in politics. For as long as the internet has existed, it's been grounded on the principle of net neutrality -- that what you read, see, or watch on the internet shouldn't be favored, blocked, or slowed down based on where that content is coming from. Net neutrality allows a small business in Minnesota to compete with the big guys, it drives innovation, and it protects free speech. But the new head of the FCC, Ajit Pai, announced that he's putting the rules that safeguard net neutrality on the chop"
Q16215328," A lot of good takeaways from this weekend. A lot of PRs, and that's something that we strive for every time we go out, to be able to give these kids a pat on the back for doing something they haven't done before. It's kind of hard to not mention those collegiate records today, both in the 4x100 and in the 800. For Raevyn, it's something we talked about as a freshman, so we're really happy and proud of a truly awesome accomplishment by her. It's unbelievable the amount of wins that the Ducks came away with down here in L.A., just a really good showing all the way around. A lot of good stuff on our end, and we're even more impressed with our support staff and operations people being able to operate three meets. We used this meet as a building block just as we do all of our meets, and now we'll get back to work and get ready for the Penn Relays. This book is for Christians who are interested in the last days. If you are not a Christian, this book will offend you. If you are not a strong Christian, this book will offend you. If you do not believe the Bible is the infallible word of The Most High God, this book will offend you. If you are a follower of the broad-way, this book will offend you. If you are a strong denominational person, this book will offend you. If you are looking for political correctness, this book will offend you. And for the few who are left, it is my hope you enjoy reading this labor of love, learn some beneficial truths, and are encourage by its teaching. This may be the most serious book; other than the Bible you have read in a long time. Today our Republican colleagues abandoned the people of Louisiana, and chose to shut down state government. Without a solution before June 30, their irresponsibility will take state police off our roads, release thousands of violent criminals without regard for public safety, prohibit LDH from inspecting abortion clinics and shutter the Governor's Office of Homeland Security just as hurricanes season begins. They could have chosen a moral budget plan that provided $500 million in tax cuts to working families, cut government spending by $200 million while fully funding our priorities like TOPS, hospitals, and care for seniors and our most vulnerable. Sadly, they refused to prioritize our people. Good opening outdoor weekend for the Ducks. It was great to have a part of our team come down to Gainesville and then be able to send the other half to Stanford where we got a lot of good times. It's amazing to get one collegiate record, but to get two in one day is pretty amazing and a special accomplishment for our girls. But those weren't the only special performances this weekend; Cole Walsh put together a good performance to win the pole vault, Sebastian Barajas hit a lifetime bests and multiple other Ducks proved what they can do. So overall, a lot of lifetime bests and wins and we're happy with how we opened outdoors. The positive approach -- a form of impact investing -- is when investors buy securities (both stocks and bonds) of firms they perceive are helping achieve social good. An example would be solar power or wind power manufacturers to encourage less dependence on fossil fuels. The flip side of SRI is the negative approach -- that is, declining to invest in companies one perceives as doing social harm. For many, this would involve foregoing investments in fossil fuel companies and gun manufacturers. Essentially, not investing in companies inconsistent with one's values. And, here is where beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The hefty $853.2 million criminal penalty should act as a deterrent to anyone seeking to perpetrate this kind of fraud in the future. This case proves that no company is above the law and that corruption that spans borders will not be tolerated by the United States. I want to thank the agents, analysts, and prosecutors who investigated this case in parallel with Brazilian authorities. We will continue to pursue any and all companies and individuals throughout the world who disregard the rule of law and threaten our fair and competitive marketplace for their personal gain. By the end of December, 1956, J. Edgar Hoover requested permission to wiretap offices and meeting places of the Nation of Islam around the country. One of the primary goals of the Bureau was to discredit the Nation of Islam around the world. The Bureau was particularly alarmed by the favorable accolades that President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana directed both Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. After Malcolm X met with Kwame Nkrumah for a second time on August 17, 1958, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) asked the FBI for its file on the Nation of Islam... I think instinctively most people have a problem with athletes representing countries where they don't live or really plan on living permanently unless they or their parents were born in that country. Some of the Kenyans and Ethiopians that have switched allegiances to run for Middle Eastern countrie"
Q26436159," We are suggesting he committed high crimes and misdemeanors and it's about time we start the process and impeach this president. As Ayanna said he is an occupant and does not rise to the level of what we expect in our president to. And it's time for us to make sure that the United States has a president they can be proud of, someone who understands the responsibility of a president and someone who carries it out. Look, we have a president that truly believes that if you say something that he doesn't agree with that you should no longer have the opportunity to exercise your First Amendment rights. This is a president who himself has said our country and its leaders are dumb. This is a president who said the state of New Hampshire is a drug-infested den. This is a president who speaks about how dirty our streets are and how inept we are as a nation. And doesn't really offer any solution in dealing with that. He abdicates his responsibility in trying to set the course on what makes our country live up to its ideals. Here we are as members of Congress doing the work that will get us the country we all deserve, one that is truly functioning for all of us, that sees and values every single person in it and one that is making sure that our shiny and wonderful Constitution is fully intact and the protections offered is enjoyed by all of us. You have an enormous audience at The Times of India [ the largest selling English-language daily newspaper in the world ] and you have an enormous responsibility to get it right. I am aware of how the narrative shaped by reporting can distort the truth. I am also very aware of how it could be limited to sharing only the official side of the story. The press is at its worst when it is a mouthpiece for a government. In your version of the story, the only problems in Kashmir are caused by what you call militants, the only people protesting to break away from India; and are all nefariously backed by Pakistan. You also make the incredible dubious claim that the Indian government's crackdown in Kashmir is good for human rights. If it was good for human rights, Ms. Singh, it wouldn't be happening in secret. You make, what I might call, a feminist case for the occupation of Kashmir and communication shutdowns, saying it will be better for women. I want to say, you know, there are people who are genuinely interested in fighting antisemitism and then there are those that are interested in weaponizing antisemitism to shut down debate on whatever they might not agree on, and vilify anybody that they might not want to have any kind of platform to have influence. And so with many of my colleagues, they understand that. One of my first acts, after I won my general election, was to write an op-ed in my local newspaper about the rise of antisemitism when the FBI report came out, and the work that we have to do, because it's really important that you're not only talking about the threats that you face, you're talking about the threats that others face. I'm someone that always sees that there is a connection to your oppression to mine. As Americans and Jews, we expect our politicians to condemn bigotry, not to fuel it. Words matter. At a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise in the U.S. and abroad, Rep. Omar is promoting the ugly, anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews have an outsized influence over politics. The notion that wealthy Jews are controlling the government is a longstanding anti-Semitic trope and one of the pillars of modern anti-Semitism, a retread of ideas spread by bigots from David Duke to Louis Farrakhan. As the people's House, the House of Representatives must not tolerate any bigotry against any community in our nation. We call on the House leadership to take immediate action, so that the message is clear: anti-Semitism will not be tolerated, I'm grateful for the solidarity shown by so many of my colleagues in Congress. I understand and appreciate the calls for members to avoid traveling to Israel and until Rashida and I are allowed to go without condition. But it is my belief that as an obligation to see the reality there for ourselves. We have a responsibility to conduct oversight over our government's foreign policy and what happens with the millions of dollars we send in aid. So I would encourage my colleagues going to meet with, see the things we were going to see. Hear the stories we were going to hear. We cannot let Trump and Netanyahu succeed in hiding the cruel reality of the occupation from us. So I call on all of you to go. The occupation is real. Most of the things that have always been aggravating to me is that we have had a policy that makes one superior to the other and we mask it with a conversation that's about justice and a two-state solution when you have policies that clearly prioritize one over the other... our relationship, really with the Israeli government and the Israeli state. And so when I see Israel institute law that recognizes it as a Jewish st"
Q40589," After months of protests, I'm inspired by this victory by thousands of indigenous activists and Water Protectors, and millions of Americans who support them. This is a victory for all people who fight for social justice. And it is a victory won by the power of peaceful protest -- a reminder of what people can do when they stand up and organize. We use environmental impact statements to understand how key projects will impact our environment and communities. I hope that Energy Transfer Partners, and most importantly, the next Administration, recognize the concerns raised by the Standing Rock Tribe. I also want to acknowledge that the responsibility for this project falls on the Energy Transfer board room, not the workers who are simply trying to do their jobs. Working Americans need our support as well. That's why I support a broad infrastructure package that creates good jobs for millions of American workers. We have a responsibility to respect the sovereignty of the Standing Rock Tribe, and to ensure their voices are heard. And we must ensure that the millions of people who depend on the Missouri and Cannonball rivers have access to clean water. As the Water Protectors at Standing Rock remind us every day: Water Is Life. Well, he's trying to use fear to manipulate people, but, look, you know, the last thing he wants to talk about is the 17 dead students in Parkland, the 20 dead children and seven more dead teachers at Sandy Hook. He doesn't want to talk about the fact that since the Assault Weapons Ban left in 2004, we've seen a 239% increase in gun-related deaths. He doesn't want to talk about the blood that is spilled all over his hands because of the lax policies that he's pushing. He wants to make people afraid, and he wants to tell people lies and distortions, rather than deal with the fact that he is essentially trafficking in fear in order to line the pockets of his clients in the gun manufacturing industry. It's really horrendous. And yet, you know, we've got to challenge him. We've got to confront him. But we've got to keep the focus on the families, Wolf. Because he wants to get this into a tennis match between, he calls me a name, I call him a name. No, this is about the families, and that is where we're going to keep our focus. I think, you know, talk about the least you can do. I mean, bump stocks, of course, we should ban them. They should never have been allowed. But what about all of the other lives we could save if we took more action? I mean, look, there should be universal background checks. You should not be able to have a high-capacity magazine. We ought to be able to step and up ban all these weapons of war that people use on our streets, so we can protect human life. But I mean, now that we've seen 59 people killed, murdered, over 500 people injured, you wonder what it's really going to take to actually take real action. I'd say that when they killed 20 kids at Sandy Hook or killed 59 people partying in Miami, I mean, now we see this tragedy. The bottom line is, there is -- the bump stock is just a minimal starting point. I really do believe that we need to put the lives of people first, and put somebody's right to possess these weapons of war way behind. The Prophet Muhammad -- peace and blessings be upon him -- his father dies before he's ever born. His mother dies before he's six. He's handed over to a foster mom who's so poor, the stories say, her breasts are not full enough to feed him. So he grows up as this quintessential orphan, and only later, at the age of forty, does he start to get this revelation. And the revelation is to stand up against the constituted powers that are enslaving people -- that are, you know, cheating people, trying to trick people into believing that they should give over their money to appease a god that's just an inanimate object. And those authorities came down hard on him! And his first converts were people who were enslaved, children, women -- a few of them were wealthy business folks, but the earliest companions of the Prophet Muhammad were people who needed justice. I found that story to be inspiring, and important to my own thinking and development. President Trump's heartless decision to upend the lives of nearly 200,000 Salvadorans has no rational justification. Deporting these Salvadorans, who have lived here for a minimum of 17 years, is a choice driven by Trump's compulsion to turn us against our neighbors. As with his decisions to end protections for Nicaraguan and Haitian immigrants last year, today the president has chosen anti-immigrant bigotry over sensible and humane policy. It tears at the conscience of our nation to send these families back to El Salvador, a country widely regarded as one of the most violent in the world. Those of us devastated by today's decision must now join together against this administration's attacks. I will continue to stand with immigrant communities and our allies to ensure Congress does the right thing a"
Q50597," The summit set us on a path toward reduced tensions that we should all welcome. But that path is littered with obstacles, and the United States must make sure the diplomacy that follows ensures meaningful verification of North Korea's commitments. For decades North Korea has offered lofty rhetoric about its commitment to peace and denuclearization, only to pocket concessions we offer as a sign of goodwill and then go right back to belligerent behavior that threatens us and our allies. To make sure this time is different, the devil will be in the details and I'll engage closely with the administration to make sure it holds North Korea to its commitments, advances U.S. interests in the region, and maintains unity with our allies. Our coordination with allies is one of our greatest strengths in a region where we face not only the perils of North Korea's nuclear weapons program, but also the challenges posed by a rising China. But I'm concerned the president disparaged our own defensive military exercises that are critical to train our allies and to keep our troops prepared. I'll continue to advocate for a robust deterrent posture on the Korean Peninsula as long as North Korea poses a threat to American servicemembers, families, and our allies. From the beginning of the renegotiation of NAFTA, which has been going on for over a year, I've been pushing for a deal that maintains North Dakota's critical trade relationships with Canada and Mexico, our largest trading partners. The renegotiation was an opportunity to address several issues important to North Dakota agriculture. Over the past year, I've had many helpful and substantive meetings with the Canadian ambassador to talk through issues in NAFTA that I hoped could be addressed to support North Dakota farmers and ranchers. The new agreement is good news for wheat growers who would no longer face an unfair Canadian grading system -- a change I've been pushing for -- but it's disappointing the concerns of cattle ranchers and potato farmers were not addressed. Additionally, this agreement doesn't address the steel and aluminum tariffs which are still putting North Dakota's energy industry and agriculture manufacturing equipment companies in jeopardy. Throughout the negotiation, I've been working with North Dakota agriculture producers to help them maintain their relationships with their buyers in Canada and Mexico, and I hope we can now move forward in a way that's good for North Dakota's ag economy. Immigrants and refugees play critical roles in supporting local economies across the country, including in North Dakota, where we see firsthand every day the contributions they make -- filling needed jobs, helping our economies grow, and becoming part of our communities. First or second generation immigrants founded major corporations like Google and IBM. These drastic cuts to the refugee resettlement program will directly impact refugees from many of the countries that already have thriving communities in North Dakota -- and will severely impact the funding level of services that our refugee resettlement agencies are able to offer. We need tough, smart national security strategies to keep Americans safe -- but such a broad strike against refugees who are fleeing war, famine and persecution and are the most heavily vetted of any individuals allowed into the country does not reflect our American values and morals. President Ronald Reagan once said that our strength comes from our `capacity to welcome those from other lands' and that our refugee policy is fundamental to our national interest -- I agree with President Reagan. It's long past time that a decision is made on the easement going under Lake Oahe. This administration's delay in taking action -- after I've pushed the White House, Army Corps, and other federal agencies for months to make a decision -- means that today's move doesn't actually bring finality to the project. The pipeline remains in limbo. The incoming administration already stated its support for the project and the courts have already stated twice that it appeared the Corps followed the required process in considering the permit. For the next month and a half, nothing about this project will change. For the immediate future, the safety of residents, protesters, law enforcement, and workers remains my top priority as it should for everyone involved. As some of the protesters have become increasingly violent and unlawful, and as North Dakota's winter has already arrived -- with a blizzard raging last week through the area where protesters are located -- I'm hoping now that protesters will act responsibly to avoid endangering their health and safety, and move off of the Corps land north of the Cannonball River. It's disappointing that one Republican member of Congress blocked Savanna's Act from passing this year. But fortunately, Rep. Goodlatte won't be around to block it in the new Congress. I've talked with Sen. Murkowski about Savanna's Act, and"
Q6938597," Formed through a partnership between the District Department of Transportation (DDOT), Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) and DC Surface Transit (DCST), the D.C. Circulator system services six distinct routes across Washington, D.C. and Rosslyn, VA. In line with the DDOT's comprehensive Sustainability Plan and related green infrastructure initiatives, which strive to improve the environment, social structure and economy of Washington, D.C., these 14 Proterra buses will reduce emissions and democratize electric transportation access to all riders throughout one of our nation's most historic cities. Currently, the Circulator provides door-to-door transportation to more than 25 museums, monuments and memorials along the National Mall. Providing more than five millions trips each year, the Circulator only costs $1 to ride, ensuring that residents, commuters, and visitors alike have access to fast and affordable transportation. Now, with the addition of 14 new battery-electric Proterra buses, these riders can experience the appeal of zero-emission transit options over traditional diesel-dependent alternatives. With 14 Catalyst E2 buses, the D.C. Circulator will displace more than 88,900 gallons of diesel per year, and eliminate more than 243,980 pounds of CO2 emissions annually. In addition to the environmental benefits, the new highly efficient electric buses will also have a positive impact on DDOT's bottom line, since they require less energy to operate and reduced maintenance. Over their 12-year lifetime, the 14 Proterra buses will result in fuel and maintenance cost savings of more than $6 million. The Catalyst E2 also holds the world record for an electric vehicle travelling 1,013.76 miles on a single charge. Washington, D.C. will continue to work with cities and countries around the globe to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The effects of climate change are already here, and without proper planning and collaboration, they will continue to get worse. It is in the best interest of our country's safety, economy, and future to take climate change seriously, and as the Mayor of a major city, I have a special obligation to protect our environment for generations to come and to create policies and programs that reflect the values of the residents I serve. Over the past two years, Washington, D.C. has launched Climate Ready D.C., entered into one of the largest municipal onsite solar projects in the U.S., and completed the largest wind power purchase agreement deal of its kind ever entered into by an American city. Going forward, our commitment to wind and solar will not yield, and we will move forward with building a more sustainable D.C.. At a time when our country should be leading the fight against climate change, it is disappointing to see us retreating into isolation. Fortunately, I am confident that leaders around the country will continue to think globally, act locally, and ensure that the U.S. remains a strong partner in the fight against climate change. We don't have the fine details of the plan yet. Move over dogs... bats and raccoons are now the number one rabies killer of people in Georgia New research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds bats are responsible for roughly 70% of rabies deaths among those infected with the rabies virus in the U.S. `There has been a shift in the last 80 years from dog rabies being the number one killer of people, to wildlife, specifically bats,' says CDC Veterinarian Emily Pieracci. She says that's largely due to pet vaccinations.

Earlier this week, the DC Inspector General alerted me to questions about the school placement of Chancellor Wilson's children. In researching the matter, we found that the Deputy Mayor and the Chancellor did not comply with the Mayor's Order related to school placements, specifically the transfer of his child from one school to another school, several weeks after the school year began. This morning, I accepted the Deputy Mayor's resignation and I have set out a series of corrective actions for Chancellor Wilson, including issuing a public apology, removing his child from the out-of-boundary school, as well as referring the matter to the Board of Ethics & Government Accountability and to the Inspector General to further examine if the code of conduct was violated.

Q2434360," Yeah, I may defer to Joe on this. I just tell you, with my experience of working with FEMA and the regional directors on flooding, these are career professionals who've done this type of stuff before. They've got us different types of equipment. I think that should help clear that up. But to be candid with you on the question, I don't believe we can... And we haven't. We've simply gone on our own, and you heard this. Governor Baker from Massachusetts, and we're doing this too, we're going out and trying to purchase these things where we can. In his state, they had two purchases ready to go. They got outbid. The outbidder was the federal government, and then took that into the national system away from the state. We hope, and Joe, maybe you can speak to this, we hope this eliminates some of those types of things and puts a much more streamlined supply chain in place. This budget forecast is good economic news for Minnesota. And the people of Minnesota have themselves to thank for that. For living here, raising their families here, and contributing to the state's economy. Minnesota's economy is working because Minnesotans are working. Minnesota's economy is also working because we have made smart budgeting decisions. We have been disciplined, kept our eye on the long-term, and invested in the things that make our state grow. Last session, we invested in our children's education. We protected Minnesotans' access to affordable health care. And for the first time in nearly 20 years, we gave more than 1 million middle class Minnesotans a tax rate cut. Clearly, this responsible approach to budgeting works. We are in a healthy economic position, and we must protect it. Tonight, the President laid out a bold, bipartisan vision to continue working to move our country forward. A vision to expand opportunities for education that will help lift low-income families out of poverty and into the middle class; a vision to reform the tax code to help parents make ends meet and pay for things like daycare and diapers; a vision to create a 21 st century economy with homegrown-energy jobs and an infrastructure to match. I don't agree with everything the President said tonight, but Republicans and Democrats should work together towards these common sense goals and help more Americans achieve their own American Dream. We've come a long ways since the dark days of Great Recession. Let's keep moving forward. Things changed in 2004. Former President George Bush came to speak in a Mankato quarry. I accompanied two students who wanted to hear the speech. When we arrived, one of my students was turned away because of a John Kerry sticker on his wallet. We were ordered to board a bus to take us away from the quarry. Though I was allowed to stay -- after offensive questioning by a campaigner -- the boys were told to leave. This was a teachable moment for them and for me. I decided that, if a command sergeant major could be harassed for wishing to hear his commander-in-chief, the political process was deeply broken. That night, I became committed to working to help repair our nation's political system. My heart is with the families, friends, and communities of these two Minnesotans. Seventy-three Minnesotans, who have experienced severe lung injury in this outbreak associated with vaping illegal THC over the past several months, is too many. In addition to these dramatic injuries, we are concerned about the long-term health impacts of vaping. The Administration is launching an aggressive outreach campaign to ensure Minnesotans know the risks of vaping and putting together bold legislative policies to tackle this crisis head on. We must ensure Minnesotans have the information, support, and resources to fight back against those profiting at the expense of our health and well-being. All the rights and privileges our nation provides we owe to the service and sacrifice of our service members, veterans and their families, and PVA understands better than any that with these rights and privileges comes great responsibility. Recent accomplishments like the Forever GI Bill and Appeals Modernization couldn't have been possible without PVA's steadfast advocacy, and our work together is far from over. Our veterans, folks with disabilities, and all Americans have many reasons to be grateful for the unwavering advocacy of PVA, and I thank this great organization for its continued service to our country. It raises out-of-pocket costs for hard-working Minnesota families, strips folks with pre-existing conditions of protections, guts Essential Health Benefits, makes draconian cuts to Medicaid, rips health care away from 24 million of our fellow Americans, and pulls billions of dollars from Medicare to provide tax cuts for pharmaceutical companies, large corporations, and America's wealthiest citizens. As if these repercussions aren't catastrophic enough, this fatally flawed bill has the potential to deny up to 7 million veterans of tax credits they use to "
Q15699836," Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Damon Grimes. I fully support Chief Craig's decision to have the Detroit Police Department conduct an independent investigation into the events leading up to his death. DPD will be presenting its findings to Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy. Police chases often have the potential for tragedy and the difference in the policies of the Detroit Police Department and the Michigan State Police highlight that concern. The Detroit Police Department policy is not to engage in high speed chases for traffic offenses or misdemeanors. In the case of felonies, the decision to continue a high speed chase is made by a supervisor. I met with Governor Snyder and urged the State Police to adopt the City of Detroit's policy when patrolling in our city. I also spoke with State Representative Sheldon Neely (D) of Flint and expressed my full support for his proposed legislation to require Michigan State Police abide by local pursuit policies when patrolling within the boundaries of a city. I am encouraged that MSP leadership is taking steps towards changing its policy. Chief Craig and the Detroit Police Department will continue to work with them to ensure that safe policing procedures are followed in the city of Detroit. Detroit lost a dear friend this morning with the passing of Judge Damon Keith, and America lost a national treasure. Judge Keith left as indelible a mark on this nation and our city as any jurist in history. During his more than 50 years on the federal bench, he handed down rulings that have safeguarded some of our most important and cherished civil liberties, stopping illegal government wiretaps and secret deportation hearings, as well as ending the racial segregation of Pontiac schools. Here in Detroit, he opened the doors for countless young law clerks, many of who have gone on to become judges themselves. I have so many fond memories of Judge Keith. I was humbled and honored the two times he administered the oath of office when I was sworn in as Mayor. I will always treasure the Thanksgiving Day I spent with him in 2016, driving him in the parade as he served as Grand Marshal. America is a better place because it had Judge Keith to help safeguard our civil liberties. Our city is a better place because he spent every day of his life as a committed and involved Detroiter. We will miss him dearly. The Hardest Hit Fund demolition program has had enormous success strengthening our neighborhoods, allowing us to demolish the unsalvageable houses and encouraging hundreds of families to move in and repair the better vacant homes. The loss of this program would have been devastating to Detroit's neighborhoods. We owe a great debt of gratitude to Debbie Stabenow, who has been relentless over the last 48 hours leading the fight to restore this program. Her hourly updates on the developments went from bleak to successful in a remarkably short period of time. Senator Stabenow led a team effort, that included great help from Senator Gary Peters, from Dan Gilbert and the Quicken team, from Senator Rob Portman from Ohio, and from Governor Rick Snyder who was in D.C. personally lobbying Republican leadership to protect this funding. It was great to see such strong bipartisan support for a program that is working. To Senator Stabenow and the entire team-Detroit offers you our deepest thanks. Aretha Franklin and her father, Rev. C. L. Franklin, have meant so much to our city for generations of Detroiters and we are all deeply saddened that Aretha has passed. Few people in the history of our city have been as universally loved or left as indelible a mark as Aretha. From the time her father gave Aretha her start in the New Bethel choir, it was clear to everyone how special she was. She was a performer without peers. Throughout her extraordinary life and career, she earned the love - and yes, the respect-of millions of people, not just for herself and for women everywhere, but for the city she loved so dearly and called home. I was honored to present Aretha with the key to our city last year and her last concert in Detroit. While she may have passed, Aretha Franklin will always have the key to our hearts. Their homicide clearance rate is tremendous. It's up in the 60s, which other cities have rates in the 20s. The ability of people to commit a crime and get away with it has gone down dramatically since he's been there. If you look at what Boston did, what New York did, what LA did, the homicide rate went down 5 percent the first year, 7 percent the next year, 6 percent the next year. Over 10 years, suddenly you are down 50 percent. It wasn't that they changed it overnight. And you are seeing that trend-line here. But that doesn't mean you don't have really bad periods of time, and this last week or so has been a terrible period of time. I was deeply saddened by the passing of Congressman John Conyers today. One of my most special memories was spending time with him at Gordon Park on"

So tomorrow we should make it clear that the first order of business should be voting on the two House measures that have already been passed, that have already been supported in various ways in the Senate, including by Republican Senators, and that would re-open the government. We need to make it clear while this is the Trump shutdown, it's enabled by the fact that Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans are trying to hide out. They have been essentially AWOL. They haven't been to the White House. They should not be essentially contracting out their votes as Senate Republicans to Donald Trump. And they need to join us in voting for measures to open the government. And so tomorrow that's what we will focus on. Then the caucus will have to decide how to proceed. Overall we're making the clear statement it cannot be business as usual. Firing FBI Director Comey has the foul stench of an attempt to stop an ongoing investigation into collusion between the Trump administration and the Russians. We know that the Russians interfered in our election. We know that every intelligence agency concluded that Russia interfered on behalf of Donald Trump. And we know that Director Comey was investigating potential collusion between Donald Trump's associates and Russia. While I've long had concerns about Director Comey, it's shocking that the Justice Department and the White House would blatantly interfere in an ongoing and very active investigation by firing him. Congress must continue its work to investigate possible collusion, but the timing of Director Comey's firing requires that the Justice Department immediately appoint a special prosecutor in order to reinstall confidence in our justice system and in our intelligence agencies. I think when he used the political charge expression of spying, he lost whatever credibility he may have had. That was music to president trump's ears. Trump immediately tweets it out. He says that a boy attorney general Barr. If he was referring to the surveillance that we know took place pursuant to the FISA warrant and is currently being reviewed by the inspector general at doj, that's one thing. Spying in itself had negative connotations and suggest there was wrongdoing. He later tried to put the toothpaste back in the tube because he admitted at the hearing he had no evidence of wrongdoing that he would present to the committee. All he did was float this charge. The president loved it and in the process, the attorney general further undermined his credibility as an independent arbiter of justice. Two years ago, the United States and the other P5 +1 nations began negotiating with the Republic of Iran with the goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. I applaud President Obama and his team for their effort to achieve this vital objective at the negotiating table. In the days ahead, I will carefully review and scrutinize this more than 80-page agreement to determine whether it meets that goal. In doing so, I intend to confer with people with competing views and perspectives. I will then exercise my best judgment as to whether the agreement achieves its goal and serves the best interests of the United States and our friends and allies. If we can achieve the goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon through peaceful means, it would be a very welcome result.

Q714269," On the campaign trail and since taking office, President Trump promised major and much-needed investments in our nation's infrastructure. The proposal released today fails to live up to the president's promises -- allocating less than 14 percent of the $1.5 trillion dollar investment he promised and relying on phantom private funding. Indeed, thanks to major cuts in the president's proposed budget to programs supporting infrastructure investments -- particularly transportation programs -- it could actually make our problems worse. While the nations with whom we compete invest in high-speed rail, modernized airports, highways, and transit systems, we are allowing our transportation system to fall further into a state of disrepair. I find it appalling that this president would borrow $1.5 trillion for a tax cut that primarily benefits the wealthiest 1 percent while putting forward an infrastructure plan that fails to meet even this country's most basic transportation and other infrastructure needs. It is clear that it will be up to the states to invest in their transportation infrastructure, and Connecticut is in desperate need of investment. For years, we have underfunded our Special Transportation Fund, and as a result, the condition of our roads, bridges, tunnels, and rails lag behind our neighboring states. That's why I have put forward a commonsense revenue proposal. With a lack of serious solutions coming from the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress, it is more important than ever that the legislature act this session to not just stabilize, but to ensure the future sustainability of the Special Transportation Fund and rebuild Connecticut. Today the state legislature ratified the largest state employee concession package in our state's history -- a deal that will save state taxpayers $1.57 billion over the next two years and approximately $24 billion in long-term savings. Make no mistake about it -- these are significant savings, and I want to thank our state workers for stepping up to the table and negotiating in good faith to produce significant, structural changes that will be the foundation of a responsible, balanced budget. I also want to recognize the legislators who analyzed the savings this deal will produce and recognized the significant structural reforms being made and the reality that we need to find solutions that put our state on firm fiscal ground as soon as possible. In addition, I want to recognize the hard work and dedication of Secretary Ben Barnes, Undersecretary for Labor Relations Lisa Egan, and the other members of the state's Office of Labor Relations for working with SEBAC leadership to negotiate this historic deal. The $1.57 billion in savings during the current biennium that this concession package will produce are a key piece toward adopting a budget for our state. I am urging legislative leaders on both sides of the aisle to work with our administration on finding a solution on this as soon as possible so that the most vulnerable populations do not suffer long-term consequences. The Trump administration's willingness to push their vile agenda, completely disregarding the U.S. Constitution and basic human decency, knows no bounds. They have heartlessly torn children away from their families, locked them in holding cages in abandoned box stores, and subsequently launched a propaganda campaign of administration officials blatantly lying to the American people about it. It brings dishonor to our country and is the cause of extreme distress for many American citizens. The Trump administration is engaging in this `zero-tolerance' practice that is reminiscent of one of the darkest moment in our history, when Japanese families in America were rounded up and detained in internment camps. Make no mistake -- the Trump administration's hands are not tied here. There is no law that mandates this practice. They are not being forced or coerced into stealing migrant children away from their parents. They are proactively electing to implement this policy and to take such actions. They are, in effect, taking these children hostage, inflicting a lifelong trauma on their innocent lives. It is cruel. It is cowardly. It's un-American. As I have stated in the past, I will not condone the use of our military reservists to participate in any effort at the border that is connected to this inhumane practice. This vile practice must end. Just days after he looked the American people in the eye and promised real action to prevent gun violence, President Trump is proposing a plan that will appease his allies in the NRA but do very little to keep our children safe. The most encouraging part of his proposal, the President's endorsement of the `Fix NICS' act, will help ensure existing law is followed, but it does nothing to ensure all gun sales are subject to background checks. Other aspects of his plan are grossly negligent and dangerously ill-informed, particularly arming teachers. Putting gu"
Q16107263," A number of important things happened in Fairfax County this year. In March, Fairfax County created an ad hoc commission to review Fairfax County Police Department policies and practices. In October, the Ad Hoc Police Practices Review Commission provided its final report, including 142 recommendations, to the Board of Supervisors. This year, over 50 community and Fairfax County government leaders launched the `Diversion First' initiative to reduce incarceration of those with mental illness by diverting nonviolent offenders to treatment instead. Also this year, the Board of Supervisors helped develop the Strategic Plan for Economic Success. This plan focuses on sustainable economic growth and development by creating the necessary environment and infrastructure. As a part of this, a working group was created to devise new, innovative strategies to repurpose older, vacant office buildings for which there is little or no demand. This issue of vacant properties has been identified as a key piece of the region's economic future. Finally, this year both the Kings Park and Ravensworth shopping centers received much needed renovations. These efforts are a vital step in rejuvenating our area's economy. Briana (Holman) is a first-generation college graduate, and I'm a first-gen. When we recruited Briana here, she was not a good student at LSU. One of the reasons that I think she and her family wanted to come here is I think they felt like the academic part, with (academic adviser) Dennis Leblanc, they were really going to take care of her and help her develop into a good student. So that is one significant part about this degree. The other part of it is, for years we didn't have minority students in our program, and now we do and here is a graduate. And the third part of it is, for me personally, I know what that feels like. I told Briana the only time I saw my dad cry -- he passed away in 1996 -- the only time I saw my dad cry was when I graduated from college. So it just puts in perspective what that means. She was bawling in Kansas City when they put (a video clip from the UNL graduation ceremony) on the big screen. She had a breakdown. It was powerful. (UNL Chancellor) Ronnie Green says, `Hey, we're missing Briana today,' and the place goes nuts. I am working with NE Representative Carl Robinson and Shield A Badge. We are organizing a silent prayer vigil to honor the 5 Dallas Police Officers who were murdered last Thursday. The purpose of the vigil is to ask for God's protection and guidance for our men and women who have sworn to protect and defend us from harm and to pray for peace in our community for all people. This is not a political event and there will be no speeches. God doesn't need to hear speeches from us to know what is in our hearts. I am hoping enough people show up that we will be able to form a human prayer chain around the entire building. The event will take place at 8PM sharp El Paso time on Thursday, July 14th at Police Headquarters, 911 Raynor. The time will coincide with the time the Dallas sniper began shooting police officers last Thursday. I know from many conversations she loved Louisville, Tom Jurich the AD, and of course Muhammad Ali said it is the greatest city in the world. One of the proudest days of my coaching career was hiring Dani back to Nebraska to be a coach. Although I still can't believe it, I am very proud of the coach she has become. She is ready for this job. She has been a captain of a national championship team, coached a national championship team, changed our recruiting, and has made me a better coach. We are so happy and proud of the work that she has done to get to this point in her coaching career. Louisville is getting a young rising star coach in Dani. We will miss her and Lane, and we thank her for all that she has done for Nebraska volleyball. This was a top-three moment of the year, seeing the reaction from the crowd and our team (to Allie Havers getting her first career kill in the first round of the NCAA Tournament). To me this is what ultimate respect is all about with a player. So even though she didn't have a major role on our team -- and she's going to be a great story and a great example for us to share with younger players and walk-ons in our program -- look at the respect that she gained from her team by the way she behaved and how hard she worked and the way she interacted with her teammates. That picture is worth a thousand words right there. And if you could hear the reaction from the fans, it would be worth 2,000 words. We tried to recruit Lexi, and we had some nice conversations, but she didn't end up visiting. I've always had this funny feeling that at some point we might have another chance to recruit her to Nebraska, and when she came on a visit three weeks ago it was unbelievable. She got to meet Dr. Kathy Farrell, the dean of the business college, because Lexi wants to major in business. Then she met with our performance team and they did "
Q13225564," On Sunday, Aug. 13, our city hosted three separate rallies in support of the people of Charlottesville, Va., and in opposition of the acts of domestic terrorism that occurred there over the weekend. I'm extremely proud that all of those events were peaceful. I'm proud of the marchers and grateful that the hundreds who participated were kept safe. And I appreciate the work of Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad and his officers to help ensure that safety. I recognize, however, that some people were upset by steps that officers took to route people off the street and onto sidewalks during a Black Lives Matter march down Broadway after one of the rallies. When I first saw the photos and videos, I too, had concerns, which I shared with Chief Conrad on Sunday night. It is important to keep in mind that the officers' responsibility was to keep people safe from traffic, to provide a safe space for them to march and to provide security in the event that counter-protesters emerged. And they were successful in those efforts. Officers are trained to use a baton in the event that a horizontal police barricade is required in situations like this. I appreciate, though, that the batons prompted feelings of fear and mistrust among many of the marchers, their families and friends, as well as some who saw the images later. That's a reality we cannot ignore. And that's why I asked the Chief to review how we should best handle incidents like this should they happen in the future. This review has started, and we will share its results with the community. I take great pride in the willingness of Louisvillians to come together to talk out our differences and our challenges, no matter how difficult. LMPD strives to be the most effective community partners they can be, and I reiterate my appreciation for their service and their desire to always improve. I also ask our marchers to maximize effective communication and cooperation with LMPD, with peace, safety and constitutional rights for all being the guiding values. I believe that trust in our community comes from transparency, and I commit that we will continue with transparency as one of my administration's values. Dear friends: Advertisement Thank you to the leadership of our organizers for pulling us together today and thanks to all who are here in body or spirit. Let us remember the America we aspire to be. Where there is fear, let us bring love Where there is racism, let us bring understanding Where there is division, let us show unity And where there is conflict, let us bring compassion. I -- and all of the nation's mayors -- are deeply troubled by this weekend's violence, and unequivocally denounce this act of terror. This is not the country we aspire to be -- and a strong nation recognizes its weaknesses, and continues to work and strive to be a more perfect union. We believe in diversity. We believe in inclusion. We believe in free speech -- but not hate speech. We believe that the great American melting pot -- black, white, and brown -- - is a strength that empowers us. We believe in taking hate and racism straight on. And we must turn these beliefs into actions of compassion, understanding, and unity. Wherever there is hatred, oppression, bigotry, or injustice for any -- black, white, brown; Christian, Muslim, Jew -- against any of us, I will speak out and condemn this unacceptable domestic terrorism, and I encourage all people -- including all of our elected officials - to do so. It is our duty as citizens to build on the values of America and it is critical that our children understand and help us achieve the America they deserve. We have much work to do in our country and in our city. Let us use this moment to build on our progress and show the world how our city, with all of its beauty and imperfections, can be a peaceful model for making the union of our city and country a home for opportunity and justice for all. Today I have appointed Margaret Handmaker and Laura Douglas to serve as Interim Co-Executive Directors of TARC. They will work to manage the day-to-day affairs of TARC and launch a national search for the Executive Director position. Margaret joins the TARC team after serving in leadership roles with Louisville Metro Government and with extensive experience in management consulting, first at Booz Allen Hamilton and then at Mercer, Inc.. Margaret's public sector experience includes leading the city's economic development and innovation teams, and serving as Secretary of Revenue for the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the Governor's Executive Cabinet. She currently sits on the LMG Board of Health, which champions equitable physical, behavioral and environmental health. Laura brings decades of communications experience with her, being named as LG&E's first Vice President of Corporate Responsibility and Community Affairs and continuing to grow the company's role in the community for 14 years. Previously, Laura worked for the Louisville Water Company and "
Q457432," I will be the first person to work with interested parties to ensure countries on the receiving end of U.S. assistance live up to their obligations. It's why I included mechanisms in a bill I introduced last year, the Central American Reform and Enforcement Act, to ensure assistance funding for the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala is distributed only if conditions set by the State Department are being met. Specifically, the State Department must certify that the Northern Triangle governments are implementing reforms and making progress on critical priorities to effectively manage the endemic violence and humanitarian crisis that has plagued the region. It's also why I recently traveled to Central America with my House and Senate colleagues on a fact-finding mission to assess the effectiveness of the Alliance for Prosperity -- a plan that then-Vice President Biden helped to develop in order to address the underlying conditions that drive irregular migration from the Northern Triangle. While there is still much work to be done, there are early indications that this funding has been effective. For instance, since 2009, Guatemala's homicide rate has been cut in half. After taking serious steps to professionalize its police force, Honduras has reduced kidnappings by nearly 80 percent since 2014. And El Salvador's murder rate has been cut in half since 2015. And it's important to note that, for every dollar the U.S. puts toward this effort, the governments of these three nations are putting in between $4 and $7 of their own, I have repeatedly pressed the Administration to ensure that the environmental rules in the renegotiated NAFTA can be fully enforced. If a trade deal does not include mechanisms to actually enforce the rules it lays out -- and if we don't ensure robust monitoring mechanisms and sufficient resources for enforcement of the deal's environmental obligations -- then it's not worth the paper it is printed on. I'm very pleased to see that my recommendations -- including additional and dedicated funding for environmental monitoring and enforcement, creation of a new interagency committee to better coordinate U.S. monitoring and enforcement efforts and newly established environmental attachés in Mexico City -- were included in the improvements negotiated by Democrats. I'm especially proud that this deal includes a new mechanism to trigger environmental reviews that gives stakeholders -- the people on the ground and those seeing potential violations firsthand -- an expanded role in enforcement matters and holds the administration accountable for pursuing enforcement of the deal's environmental obligations. I was glad to work with Chairman Blumenauer to develop this provision, and I'm pleased it was included to ensure that environmental violations can be investigated, but also remedied in a substantive and timely manner. These new measures will help to ensure that the agreement's environmental goals can actually be met and those that break the rules can actually be held accountable. Most employees would be asked to continue to do their jobs and protect our nation but on an `IOU.' That includes Border Patrol agents who protect our borders, Transportation Security Administration employees who help keep our skies safe, and Coast Guard crews who patrol our waters. We'll essentially be asking them to continue to do their jobs, but we're not going to pay them. A Department funding lapse would also stop paychecks for Coast Guard retirees, some of whom dedicated their entire lives to serving our country. This is not the way we should be treating the public servants who risk their lives to keep us safe. This bill would reverse that injustice and adheres to one of my core principles: the `Golden Rule,' to treat others as we want to be treated. The hardworking men and women at the Department of Homeland Security and the retirees who honorably served our nation should receive the pay they are owed for their service regardless of this reckless and manufactured-funding crisis created by Congress. I am hopeful that this bill won't be necessary because we in Congress can come together before Friday, as I've been urging, and pass a clean funding bill for the Department for the remaining months of the fiscal year. But at a bare minimum, we shouldn't let the men and women at the Department of Homeland Security suffer just because Congress can't do its job. Shamefully, this administration has focused on fourth century `solutions' to block migrants from entering our country, rather than helping them address the misery in their homelands -- misery we've helped create and are complicit in. If President Trump wants to get serious about solving this problem, then we need long-term and comprehensive solutions. The good news is that we already know what works: We need to seriously address the root causes of migration from Central American countries, not merely the symptoms at our border. Only onc"
Q24015," Literally, we are one day away if we don't get test kits from the C.D.C.. Then we wouldn't be able to be tested in Montana. We have gone, time and time again, to the private side of this. The private market, in where the private market is telling us that it's a national resource that are then taking our orders apart. Basically, we're getting our orders canceled. And that's for PPE. That's for testing supplies. That's for testing equipment. So, while we're trying to do all the contact tracing, we don't have adequate tests to necessarily do it. We don't have the [ inaudible ] along the way, and we're not finding markets to be able to do that. Along the way are private suppliers. So we do have to rely on a national chain of distribution or we're not going to get it. But we are doing our best to try to do exactly that. Like, Gallatin County would be an example where we have almost half of our overall state's -- those are the positives. We're trying to shift the supply to really isolate that and do the contact tracing, but we just don't have enough supplies to even do the testing. The Treasury Secretary stood up and said, `you know, there's been this rule that's been in place that these 501 C4s, these corpororations that get involved in politics, that they have to disclose their donors to the IRS, and we're gon na repeal that rule' . That was a month ago today. Think about this. Now, truly a Russian could write a check and influence our elections. We would never know. This rule was around since 1971. Richard Nixon was not kind of the model of good government and transparency. So we can accept this as like this is the new that corporations can control any part of our elections, any part of the process, or we can do something about it. That's another area where I and my Department of Revenue sued in federal court -- that case is pending -- and I think that we will be able to roll that back. I do have a story of how I've been able to bring people together, and I think that's in part what our country desperately needs. I will tell you, I haven't just gone to Iowa. Before I even went to Iowa, I went to places like Michigan and Wisconsin. Two weeks ago, Arkansas as an example, used to be, had a Democratic governor, had a Democratic Legislature. It's fundamentally changed. Now the values of the people have not changed. So right now, what I'm doing is listening, and that's honestly as far as it goes. But I've been so actually blessed with the opportunity both to come to places like here in Iowa. I'm blessed to have a friend like Tom Miller, who is the attorney general who I got serve with when I was A.G. And I've had the opportunity to learn more, then, so that's as far as it goes now. After that election, I was asked to start traveling quite a bit because I was the only Democrat to get reelected in a state that Trump won. When I would say outside Montana that, `yeah 25-to-30 percent of my voters voted for Donald Trump,' far too often you would hear either, `what's wrong with those voters?' or a little skepticism, like, `what's wrong with you Bullock? You wouldn't ever hear, like, `how is it that people were voting their economic interests, their hopes for their kids, their hopes for health care, and they voted with a Democrat? So that got me thinking that I have something to add to this. But if the premise is that Democrats have lost white working-class men, then that could be a [ national ] problem, yeah. In 2020, you could weave together a coalition based on identity politics. If that's the bedrock foundation, you might win the presidency, but you'll lose the country. I don't want to be part of a party that ideologically only reflects the East and West Coasts. And while our experiences are different, I think a Native American, Latino, or me, as parents, have the same aspirations for our kids. Your hopes are the same. Making sustainable investments in critical infrastructure and putting shovels in the ground is essential to our continued economic growth and to the creation and support of good-paying jobs for Montanans. It's why I have proposed investments in projects in rural and urban communities all across the state. I hope the Montana Legislature will recognize the need for these projects, as emphasized by this report card, and work with me to make certain of a thriving economy and strong quality of life for communities, businesses and residents, Until yesterday, there were three nationally qualified [ polls ] that everybody was saying count, and then they announced they weren't going to count one. But look -- I only got in about a month ago, and I could have gotten in earlier, but my legislature was still moving. I had to get Medicaid expansion passed to ensure health coverage for nearly 100,000 people. If I ever had to choose again between campaigning for 100,000 donors and securing health care for 100,000 people, it's the easiest decision I'll ever make. I know that we've done more, to the earlier question, tha"
Q4772543," Americans spend 5.5 billion hours in traffic each year, costing families more than $120 billion in extra fuel and lost time. American businesses pay $27 billion a year in extra freight transportation costs, increasing shipping delays and raising prices on everyday products. Also, 65 percent of our Nation's roads are in less than good condition; one in four bridges require significant repair or can't handle current traffic demands and 45 percent of Americans lack access to basic transit services. Underinvestment impacts safety too. There were over 32,000 highway traffic fatalities in 2013, and roadway conditions are a significant factor in approximately one-third of them. Building on our previous investments to date, the U.S. Department of Transportation is taking a concrete step toward making a substantial federal investment in the Hudson Tunnel and Portal North Bridge projects, and we're looking forward to continuing to work closely with our partners in New York and New Jersey to make a new rail tunnel a reality. The existing Hudson tunnel is more than 100 years old and was badly damaged by Super Storm Sandy, and if it fails, it would effectively shut down passenger rail service from Manhattan to New Jersey and the southern portion of the Northeast Corridor, I believe in the `Good Will Hunting' approach, in the idea that genius can come from anywhere. The idea that sometimes, if you leave an equation on a chalkboard, then a Matt Damon might come along, and he will find you an answer. And that's sort of what Beyond Traffic is. It's an equation on the chalkboard, data on the page. And we hope that someone will come along and take the study to their apartment, or their garage, or their university. And we hope that they will read that data and develop a concept that, literally, redraws the map. You are not only going to improve infrastructure with this project you're going to transform communities along the rail line. Providing opportunity for the region's residents and businesses by creating jobs, raising incomes, connecting commuters to workplaces and services. And these improvements will provide mobility for vulnerable populations and unlocking the full potential of over $60 million dollars in federal investments made along the rail line. And I'm excited and proud to see what you're doing here in Vermont. Setting the bar for safety to the highest possible standard requires commitment from everyone-from drivers to industry, safety organizations and government at all levels. The U.S. Department of Transportation will do our part by aggressively using all tools at our disposal-research into new safety systems and technologies, campaigns to educate the public, investments in infrastructure and collaboration with all of our government partners to support strong laws and data-driven approaches to improve safety. The L does need more capacity. It does need more reliable service. And the million-plus riders who board L trains every weekday deserve better than slow zones and delays... That is why our department is so proud to provide a $120 million TIFIA loan and a $16 million TIGER grant on top of that so that major repairs can be made... to help you upgrade the track and upgrade signals and power supplies and stations so the trips on the Blue Line are safer and faster and more reliable. We need to raise the standard of bicycle and pedestrian safety so those numbers are being reported accurately to us and [ so we can [ measure ourselves year to year just like we do with everything else. It's going to take work and a lot of cooperation with state and local officials but I do believe that as you start seeing people using bicycle and pedestrian facilities as part of their every day life, it will be important for us to raise the bar when it comes to safety, Somewhere along the lines, we got this impression that, if we just got the trust fund plussed up, that would solve our problems. And the reality is, is that the spending levels of the trust fund, even according to CBO [ the Congressional Budget Office ], if you just got the trust fund leveled off into last year's numbers, you'd still be about $11 billion or $12 billion short in terms of just the maintenance that needs to happen on an annual basis in this country. America's capacity for creativity, innovation, and invention is the envy of the world. Over the past seven years, the Administration has strengthened our foundation for innovation through investments and reforms to drive technological breakthroughs that will power the American economy and inspire the world for generations to come. Today, we're building on that track record by finalizing new ground rules to govern the commercial use of unmanned aircraft systems, This is not an action plan. It is a catalyst for public conversation about mobility issues and how we can best solve them. Lately, I hear a lot of people talking about the past-how we used to run our transportation systems. But in the past, people l"
Q1323196," We cannot let America's new normal become mass gun violence followed by thoughts and prayers and no action. When tragedies keep occurring, leaders step up to help stop them. And that's exactly what Hillary Clinton did this morning. She put forward a comprehensive plan of commonsense steps that would help keep guns from criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill. Her plan does two important things: it respects the Second Amendment Rights of law-abiding gun owners like me, and it keeps guns away from people we all agree shouldn't have them. While Republicans in Congress continue to turn a blind eye, and GOP Presidential candidates callously dismiss horrific acts of mass gun violence, Hillary is fighting for our families and for the safety of our communities. I look forward to fighting this fight by her side, and putting policies in place that will both respect the rights of gun owners and save the lives of thousands of Americans. and we realize how challenging it can be to understand all the potentials for every customer and vehicle. Virtual Salesman ensures that our dealers will maximize their dollars per sale, increase their close ratio, and do it with pinpoint accuracy. Virtual Salesman is powered by the OmegaLink vehicle database and automatically matches interface modules and data start systems to the selected vehicle. The system can be set up in minutes, and if dealers really want to bring Virtual Salesman to life, it offers custom vehicle profiles that allow them to limit which systems are offered per vehicle, choose their preferred interface, and even adjust the total labor for perfect estimates every time. Once customers design their system, Virtual Salesman will email the quote to the customer and dealer with contact info, and an itemized list of all parts, upgrades, and accessories for easy follow-up and scheduling. Estimates say that climate change will cost Americans more than $500 billion each year by the end of this century. We cannot afford to wait any longer to address this existential threat. Today I am proud to lead my colleagues in unveiling the GREEN Act, a comprehensive approach to addressing the threat of climate change through our tax code. This bill will build on existing tax incentives that promote renewable energy and increase efficiency and create new models for technology and activity to reduce our carbon footprint. I've long said that if we don't address climate change, nothing else matters as we won't have a planet to pass on to our next generation. The GREEN Act is a critical step forward in our fight to tackle climate change head on. Today, apprenticeships are available in a huge range of sectors and levels and are open to everyone, regardless of age, social background or qualifications and are fast becoming one of the most worthwhile career paths allowing people to earn and learn at the same time. With increased tuitions fees driving up the cost of university and putting it out of reach to some, we forecast that apprenticeships, particularly Degree Apprenticeships, will become increasingly more important to the UK economy, and predict exponential growth in their uptake in the near future. We have seen enormous productivity and value in bringing apprentices in to our business and strongly encourage others to follow our lead. This deal, negotiated in secret, gives Westlands a permanent water contract, among other concessions, which precludes any further environmental review or contract renewals. In return, Westlands will retire 100,000 acres of farmland, but that still leaves nearly 300,000 acres of impaired lands open to irrigation, opening the door to further pollution of our rivers and streams. The agreement includes no stipulations for oversight of drainage operations and no metrics by which to measure Westland's compliance. While this brings an end to a long-standing dispute that had to be resolved, the concessions of this agreement go too far, placing our communities, water supply, and environment at risk. With qualifying income levels set across-the-board, many hard-working families in high-cost areas like ours don't qualify for subsides and therefore can't get affordable insurance. This bill will help make The law now allows those making between 138 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level to qualify for premium tax credits to help them buy health insurance through the ACA's exchanges. At this level, an individual making up to $45,960 and a family of four making up to $94,200 This income threshold, however, doesn't take into account the cost of living for different geographic areas, the legislators said. San Francisco is treated the same as a family living in a small town in, O.J. Simpson became a free man at 12:08 a.m. Sunday when he was released from Lovelock Correctional Center in Northern Nevada.

Q1368405," President Trump delivered a speech tonight that was virtually devoid of substance. There was the long-awaited infrastructure plan which, instead of truly investing in our nation's future and its infrastructure, leaves rural America behind, puts local taxpayers on the hook, and leaves our communities hostage to highway robbery from Wall Street. If the President has his way, instead of the Eisenhower Interstate System, Americans should get ready for `Trump Tolls.' And Trump's remarks did little to allay the concerns of our nation's 800,000 DREAMers. Instead of recognizing the real human toll of his actions against DACA recipients, Trump has turned the lives of DREAMers into bargaining chips for a $25 billion slush fund to build his border wall, and extreme right-wing immigration ideas that would cut legal immigration in half. I was honored to have Leonardo Reyes, an Oregon DREAMer, as my guest in the House Chamber tonight. Leo came to America when he was ten. He grew up here, went to school here, built a life here, and now works for the state of Oregon trying to give back to the community he calls home. He is an inspiration to me and should be to all Americans. Americans support restoring legal status to our DREAMers. We have a bipartisan bill on the table. President Trump just needs to get to `yes.' America was founded as a nation for `We the People,' not `We the Powerful.' Under Trump, the state of our union is moving further and further from this founding vision -- but each of us has the power to help our country change course, to reembrace our founding ideals of equality and opportunity, and create an economy that works for working Americans. Trump's speech tonight made it even clearer than ever before: It's time for `We the People' grassroots America to rise up, get involved, and take our country back in 2018. We knew that if Donald Trump picked anyone off his list of extremists, fundamental rights would be at stake. Now, the decision has arrived, and everything we feared is on the line. Roe v. Wade could be overturned and abortion and forms of contraception criminalized. Americans with pre-existing conditions could lose life-saving health care. Marriage equality could be overturned. Racial inequality and blatant voter suppression could be further embraced by the highest court in the land. These are no longer wild hypotheticals; these are real and imminent threats to our nation. The justices of the Supreme Court should be selected based on the wisdom, experience, and values they bring to the job, not hand-picked by ideological organizations committed to rolling back the ability of women, minorities, workers, and consumers to participate fully and freely in society. To safeguard the rights of all Americans and our founding vision of a `We the People' nation, Americans must rise up and make their voices heard in the U.S. Senate. Assad's attacks against his own people are heinous and reprehensible. There is no doubt that Assad has committed numerous war crimes, including this week's horrific chemical weapons attack, and that he must be held accountable by the international community. Assad's actions are a clear violation of international treaties and Syria's own recent agreements, and all nations -- including Russia, China and Iran -- should condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms and work together to act in response. It is essential, however, that before the U.S. undertakes any ongoing military campaign in Syria, the President consult with Congress and seek congressional authorization, in accordance with Article I of the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution. Many Americans are deeply wary of being drawn into another war in the Middle East. We owe the nation full consideration of the complete range of options, including pursuit of an international agreement to end the war and end Assad's reign of terror. Well it really reflects different messages coming out of the campaign which happens in a complicated rush campaign because the core of the message is, look, there is still a path to victory here, yes. Yes he lost in New York, but he lost by less in NY than President Obama lost eight years previously. He [ Bernie ] did a percent better. So it's all how you frame it. And certainly Hillary Clinton's home state senator, home state turf. She had campaigned in her senate races in every village and borough; she knew the state inside and out. So it was an extraordinary challenge [ for Sanders ]. There's other challenges ahead that present a very different circumstances and right now there are citizens and grass roots organizations who are saying `we have to change the model of how are economy and our political system works' . And the person who best understands the fact that we must change that is Bernie Sanders. The third was that the same individual [ Burck ] proceeded -- apparently it was the individual, this is the understanding of folks -- to mark 141,000 documents `committee confidential,"
Q505598," The Cross Harbor Rail Freight Tunnel project, which I have supported for more than 30 years -- from my time in the State Assembly to serving in the U.S. Congress -- will finally connect the New York metropolitan region to the national freight rail grid by removing trucks from our streets and diverting them to the underutilized rail network. It will change the way we move goods throughout our region for the better, with economic, environmental, health, safety and cost saving benefits for millions of people. I want to especially thank our Governor, Andrew Cuomo, who has been a strong long-term advocate for this project. He is a leader who seeks to solve the toughest of problems, and I have tremendous respect for that. I also want to congratulate the Port Authority, the Federal Highway Administration, and the coalition of elected officials, business and labor leaders, and transportation and environmental advocates who have supported this project from the beginning, and thank them for their tireless work in getting us to this important milestone. The Special Counsel has now secured guilty pleas from President Trump's personal attorney, his campaign manager, his deputy campaign manager, a foreign policy advisor to his campaign, and his National Security Advisor. He has filed 191 charges against more than thirty individuals -- almost all of whom are in President Trump's orbit, Vladimir Putin's orbit, or both. The President can pretend that this investigation has nothing to do with him and nothing to do with Russia, but these indictments speak for themselves. We must allow this investigation to run its course without interference from the President or his allies on Capitol Hill. As the new Congress begins, these developments make clear that my colleagues and I must step in and provide accountability. No one is above the law, not even the President, and our job will be to check his impulse to abuse his office to protect himself. We will do everything in our power to allow the Special Counsel to finish his work and follow the facts and the law to their conclusion. The bomb that ripped apart the Chelsea neighborhood last Saturday night has reminded New Yorkers of our ability to come together in response to tragedy. The scars of this attack will remain for a long time, as we witnessed, once again, the impact of terrorism in our City. Whenever New Yorkers are attacked, we stand united behind the men, women and families who have suffered and our heroic first responders for their valiant efforts. It is important that we stand with those in Chelsea who have been affected by this most recent act of destruction. I commend Governor Cuomo and the New York State Legislature for acting quickly in setting up the emergency loan program for the small businesses impacted by this attack, and hope it can help bring some much needed relief as we continue to recover from act of violence. I am deeply disappointed by today's events at the United Nations Security Council, particularly the United States' abstention, damaging any hope for, or progress on, an eventual peace agreement. Rather than bringing a peaceful accord nearer, the United Nations Security Council's approval of today's one-sided resolution pushes both sides further apart. The resolution seeks to create an irresponsible and inaccurate narrative, making no mention of Palestinian responsibility, either for their incitement of violence or their refusal to return to talks with the Israelis, and only serves the purpose of seeking to delegitimize Israel on the world stage. The only way there can ever be an Israeli-Palestinian peace is through direct negotiations between the parties, not with imposed solutions, I am pleased to join Chairman Goodlatte in introducing this bill to help facilitate the return of stolen artwork and heritage lost to the Nazis. This legislation will ensure that the rightful owners and their decedents can have their claims properly adjudicated. Among the many horrific crimes and atrocities committed during the Holocaust, the Nazis also engaged in comprehensive, systematic theft of art and property all across Europe. The scope of their deeds was massive, and the damaging effects remain with us today -- still seeking justice and some form of recompense. While no legislation or act of contrition will ever reverse the many horrors committed by the Nazis, one thing we can do is establish a fair judicial process so that claims can be properly addressed. Stonewall was the spark that ignited the movement for LGBT civil rights, a spark which continues to burn around the world today. We must ensure that the events of Stonewall, the persecution of the LGBT community, and the brave individuals who fought -- and continue to fight -- to overcome it are given the place they deserve in our nation's history. Designating a national park at this site would ensure that the contributions of the activists and individuals who helped launch the fight for civil rights are recogni"
Q312644," While this strategy may have helped S&P avoid disappointing its clients, it did major harm to the larger economy, contributing to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The credit rating agency's agreement represents one of the government's key efforts to hold accountable market players deemed responsible for contributing to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. With the case now concluded, the government moves a big step closer to wrapping up its years-long pursuit of Wall Street wrongdoing from the crisis. McGraw Hill Financial Inc. said in a statement that the settlement contains no findings of violations of law by itself, S&P Financial Services or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. Half the amount S&P is paying, or $687.5 million, will go to the 19 states and the District of Columbia. S&P also announced Tuesday that it will pay $125 million in a separate settlement with the California Public Employees' Retirement System to resolve its claims against the company regarding ratings on three structured investment vehicles. The settlement is not subject to judicial approval. The settlement announced Tuesday came after months of negotiations. The Justice Department filed civil fraud charges against S&P two years ago this week. It accused the company of failing to warn investors that the housing market was collapsing in 2006 because doing so would hurt its ratings business. The Justice Department had demanded $5 billion in penalties from S&P when it sued the company in February 2013. The payment of about $1.38 billion to settle the case is less than S&P's revenue in 2013 of $2.27 billion. The three big rating agencies â € now, my brother's a retired law enforcement officer. And he always tells me that cops have the right, you know, to come home at night. And that's exactly right. These are people who protect us, who keep us safe, and they have the right, they have the right to come home at night. You know, seeing this attack last night really kind of turned my stomach because in the last week since the Justice Department released its pattern and practice report on Ferguson, I thought we'd begun to see really important signs of progress. [ There ] were good-faith steps being taken within the city's leadership to move in a new, more cooperative direction, that I think is beneficial to law enforcement and to community residents. But make no mistake, we still have - we still have a long way to go to bring about this systemic change that is needed, and that is long overdue in that area. But I think the early indications have really, truly been positive. But what happened last night was - was a pure ambush. What happened last night was a pure ambush. This was not someone trying to bring healing to Ferguson. This was a damn punk, a punk, who was trying to sow discord in an area that is trying to get its act together and trying bring together a community that has been fractured for too long. This really disgusting and cowardly attack might have been intended to unravel any sense of progress that exists, but I hope that that does not, in fact, happen. By creating safe districts -- they locked themselves into power and they shut out voters from the electoral process. In particular they used racial gerrymandering to pack minorities into districts in ways that diminished their voting power. What they did -- I think -- is inconsistent with our founding documents, inconsistent with the voting rights act and inconsistent with who we say we are as a nation. It's not a coincidence that after they gerrymandered states like Texas, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin to lock in their power in the state legislature, they systematically passed voter I.D laws. The North Carolina legislature passed a law which one federal judge said targeted African-Americans, `with surgical precision.' You have to understand, for a judge to use that kind of language is an indication of how strongly that judge felt. Federal judges are very careful with the language that they use. To say `with surgical precision' is a testament to how bad the situation was -- and is -- in North Carolina. Republicans have systematically attacked American's right to vote and voting power. How much of that discretion are you going to use? What are the policymakers going to do? What is the President of the United States going to do? What is the President of the United States going to say about what police officers ought to be able to do? What is the President of the United States going to say about stop-and-frisk? If the President, with all the things that person has to consider, were to come out and say we should really consider whether or not stop-and-frisk is a police technique we should support, would have huge ripple effects. It makes police chiefs in small places and police chiefs in large cities think about whether or not this is something that they want to do. Overturning something in the Supreme Court is one way to do it; electing a Preside"
Q6533414," The COVID-19 data released today reveals that the virus has had a disproportionate impact on communities of color. To say it is disturbing would be an understatement. Public health crises like this both reveal and exacerbate the depths of inequality in our society. I thank Governor Cuomo for his efforts to address these devastating disparities, but we must all continue to do more. We must expand treatment, rapid testing, and tracking with a sharp eye toward marginalized communities. We must also continue to increase hospital capacity, resources for safety net hospitals, and expand language access to ensure those communities hit hardest have the information they desperately need. Lastly, more is needed to protect our essential workers, many of whom are people of color. That means providing and requiring protective equipment for public transportation workers; grocery store, delivery, and warehouse workers; home health aides, nursing home workers, and others. It is imperative that we also think long term about tackling inequality head on and ensuring that universal healthcare access is a right, not a privilege. This is call to action. Let's heed it. The nature and magnitude of the harms currently being imposed by the Rule warrant temporary relief from the stay, particularly when these harms were not known to the parties or the Court when the Court considered defendants' stay application. Although this case has always concerned issues of public health and welfare, the COVID-19 outbreak and its ramifications on public health and the economy present sudden and stark new circumstances not previously considered by the Court and have vastly changed and amplified the irreparable harms caused by the Rule. And the likelihood of these harms occurring is no longer a prediction. The Rule's devastating effects are happening now. Given these new circumstances, the Court should modify or lift its stay temporarily to meet the exigencies and equities of the current public-health and economic crisis. These taxi medallions were marketed as a pathway to the American Dream, but instead became a trapdoor of despair for medallion owners harmed by the TLCs unlawful practices. The very government that was supposed to ensure fair practices in the marketplace engaged in a scheme that defrauded hundreds of medallion owners, leaving many with no choice but to work day and night to pay off their overpriced medallions. What's worse is that the TLC knew their actions were affecting some of the city's most financially exposed immigrant families. We are taking action to ensure New York's hard-working taxi drivers can be made whole again and are repaid the hundreds of millions the city unlawfully pocketed. Immigrants provide us with health care, care for our elderly, prepare and deliver our food, clean our hospitals and public spaces, and take on so many other essential roles in our society, which is why we should all be working to make testing and health coverage available to every single person in this country, regardless of immigration status. Our country cannot afford to wait, yet the sustained application of the Public Charge Rule continues to harm this nation's public health and our economy to its core. We're asking the Supreme Court to temporarily halt this rule until this national crisis is over because any rule that threatens an immigrant's well-being, threatens all of us. It is essential that the decommissioning of Indian Point be rapid, complete, and safe. In that light, I have multiple, grave concerns about the application now before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that would hand off the responsibility for Indian Point's decommissioning to a company with absolutely no experience in such an enormous, complex, and consequential undertaking. I am committed to ensuring -- through legal action if necessary -- that the State of New York is granted full participation in this application proceeding and all other decision-making related to Indian Point's decommissioning. The health, safety, and well-being of New Yorkers deserve nothing less. Despite President Trump's attempt to punish New Yorkers for passing its own laws and standing up to his xenophobic policies, New York will not back down. Already, 13 additional states and the District of Columbia have passed similar laws to the one the Trump Administration cites in its letter, so we will resist efforts that target New Yorkers and cut off our access to Global Entry or any other Trusted Traveler Program. As the state's attorney and chief law enforcement officer, I will continue to vigorously defend New York laws and our state's residents against the president's vindictive actions. New Yorkers will not be targeted or bullied by an authoritarian thug. This settlement is an important first step towards achieving justice for the death of Eric Garner and will hopefully bring a level of closure to the Garner family. However, this was never about money. We must honor the memory of Eric Garner"
Q19673," While I strongly disagree with the [ Supreme ] Court's decision, I accept it. For the sake of our unity and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession. I also accept my responsibility, which I will discharge unconditionally, to honor the new president elect and do everything possible to help him bring Americans together, in fulfillment of the great vision that our great Declaration of Independence defines and that our Constitution affirms and defends. This serves to remind us that we are one people with one shared history and a shared destiny. [ Our ] history gives us many examples of contests as hotly debated and fiercely fought. And each time, the victor and the vanquished have accepted the result peacefully and in the spirit of reconciliation. The disappointment [ my supporters and I share ] must be overcome by our love of country. This is America. Just as we fight hard when the stakes are high, we close ranks and come together when the contest is done. While there will be time enough to debate our continuing differences, now is the time to recognize that that which unites us is greater than that which divides us. There is a higher duty than what we owe to political party. This is America and we put Country before party. We will stand together behind our new President. Are the dangers we now face so much greater than those that led Franklin Delano Roosevelt to famously remind us that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself? Is America in more danger now than when we faced worldwide fascism on the march -- when our fathers fought and won a world war on two fronts simultaneously? Is the world more dangerous than when we faced an ideological enemy with thousands of missiles poised to annihilate our country at a moment's notice? Fifty years ago, when the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union was raising tensions in the world and McCarthyism was threatening our liberties at home, President Dwight Eisenhower belatedly said, `Any who act as if freedom's defenses are to be found in suppression and suspicion and fear confess a doctrine that is alien to America.' Edward R. Murrow, whose courageous journalism was assaulted by Senator Joseph McCarthy, declared, `We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason. ' Gore's reticence, his friends and allies say, is in part to maximize his own leverage on fighting climate change. But... also reflect [ s ] a complicated relationship with [ Hillary ]... [ A ] rivalry started when the two baby boomer policy wonks arrived in the White House in 1993. Gore got the new administration's environmental and technology portfolios. Bill Clinton raised eyebrows by assigning his wife what would become an ill-fated attempt to pass comprehensive health-care reform legislation... Gore's own efforts to take the next big step in his political career suffered in no small part because of the roller coaster politics associated with the Lewinsky saga and the general drama that has become synonymous since then with anyone running for office named Clinton. I'll tell you what it reminds me of, years ago when I was working on the issue of nuclear arms control, there was a movement called the Nuclear Freeze Movement, and it was criticized as being naive, and experts said that it had elements that were unrealistic. But 75 percent of the American people said, `We're in favor of a nuclear freeze.' And the particulars didn't all get enacted, but it served as a mechanism for the American people to move their political leaders, including Ronald Reagan, who started off in the campaign of 1980 talking about the evil empire and talking about massive build-ups of nuclear weapons and ended up advocating a nuclear zero initiative with Gorbachev in the then Soviet Union. So I think the Green New Deal is a bit like that. So 12 years ago, they did that episode that had me hysterically warning about a nonexistent problem, this ManBearPig. And for years, I get this question. So now, all of a sudden, a few weeks ago out of the blue they come out with these new episodes and the kids on South Park realize ManBearPig is real! Honestly, I was so impressed. I don't know these guys, Matt and Trey. And I kind of thought they were nihilists of sorts. But funny nihilists. And when they come out with this new thing, and they had the kids come out and seek me out to help them. But my character forces them to apologize. And they all say `Oh, we're so sorry, Al Gore.' ManBearPig is real! I thought it was a hell of a statement by South Park and I appreciated it a lot. Removing the United States from the Paris Agreement is a reckless and indefensible action. It undermines America's standing in the world and threatens to damage humanity's ability to solve the climate crisis in time. But make no mistake: if President Trump won't lead, the American people will. Civic leaders, mayors, governors, CEOs, investors and the majority of the business community will take up this challenge. We are in the middle of a clea"
Q7595813," The Electoral College is racist and classist. We have to remember the Electoral College was not designed because people were worried about Idaho not having enough votes. We didn't know about Idaho. What we did know was that in the south, the populations in the south had equal or roughly equal populations to the north. However, because black people were not considered human or citizens, they wanted their bodies to count for the purposes of the population count but not their humanity. And the Electoral College to give southern states the ability to count the bodies of slaves, but not have to allow them to cast votes, and thus the Electoral College was born as a compromise. The other challenge was that in the north a lot of them didn't want immigrants making decisions, and they didn't believe that immigrants and those who were not considered well-educated should be making decisions about who the executive of our nation should be. So it was a combination of racism and classism. Both of those things should be flung to the far reaches of history and the Electoral College needs to go. I'm running to be the governor of Georgia and I believe that we have to have comprehensive, bi-partisan legislation to address the federal responsibility for immigration. As the governor of Georgia my responsibility (would be) to make sure that everyone who is within our borders is protected and served by our state, that's our constitutional obligation and it's our moral obligation. And to that end, I do not intend to support programs that use our law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws. That is not our responsibility and it is a cost to our communities. We also make everyone less safe when Georgia's law enforcement participates in federal immigration because people will go into the shadows, they won't report crimes and they won't testify about crimes they've seen. They will let themselves be harmed and they will become more vulnerable which makes our state more vulnerable. So, my intent is to make sure I focus on Georgia's responsibilities to protect and serve everyone within our borders every single day. The removal of the bass relief of Confederates from Stone Mountain has been a constant debate since the state bought the property in 1958. Paid for by founders of the 2nd KKK, the monument had no purpose other than celebration of racism, terror & division when carved in 1915. We must never celebrate those who defended slavery and tried to destroy the Union. Confederate monuments belong in museums where we can study and reflect on that terrible history, not in places of honor across our state. The managers of Stone Mountain have taken steps to educate with a powerful audio tour to return the listener to the horrors of slavery. But the visible image of Stone Mountain's edifice remains a blight on our state and should be removed. State leg led by the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus have pushed for action for decades. I supported action then & I renew calls now. If you were told that you can't have this job because an immigrant took this job you feel -- and I'm not legitimizing any of the underlying racism, the-isms, the discrimination and bigotry -- but without a counterpoint of here is the opportunity for you to have what you need. I think that is where we miss our chance sometimes. That is what I'm looking for in this crop of 2020 candidates. It's our ability to say we all want the same things. We want healthcare. We want economic security. We want education. We want reforms that make our lives stronger and better, and this fear is not delivering that. We have now had three and a half years of fear as a governing idea, and it does not work. Therefore we have to have a vision that says that here is what will work. We stand as an example of what should be because of how badly we have failed. America is an example of why democracy is important because we have had to correct ourselves so many times. Acknowledging that black people are actually wholly human, acknowledging that women should be allowed to be part of the body politic, making Native Americans citizens, moving away from our fairly xenophobic immigration policies over time, each of those moments of correction stand as signals to the rest of the world that we can get better, not that democracy is perfect, that we are made more perfect by each of our corrections and that when we stop correcting ourselves, and worse when we celebrate our ignominy we undermine our value as part of an international conversation. There was never a hack. There was never a problem on the side of the Democratic Party. What was wrong was that he failed to do his job. He is abusing his power. He is both the candidate, the elector and he is the guardian of the system. That is wrong and it is an abuse of power that should not go unchallenged and he should not be allowed to point fingers and lay blame because he has failed once again to do his job. He has never once taken responsibility for an"
Q22686," Under what pretext did Israel's survival become an obstruction to our national interests in the Mideast? When did it become America's stance that in order to have a successful Mideast policy, America would first have to win the hearts and gain the trust of the Muslim majority in that region? By having America pressure Israel to limit and suppress their military responses to the constant rocket attacks, random stabbings, bus bombing and rock assaults on Israelis and tourists by Hamas and the Palestinians, was America trying to curry favor with the Palestinian Authority and the Muslim world? Does American policy and Trump accept the unbelievable premise that it is the Muslims and the Palestinian terrorist who are the true victims here? Believing that a Palestinian-State agreement is a must to bring peace and economic stability to the West, America has accepted the erroneous concept that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the underlying cause for the ever-increasing tensions between Arab nations and the United States. Moreover, it appears that America believes that its resolution will bring the reconciliation with the Islamic world that is needed to ensure her economic security. Nothing can be further from the truth. In fact, while America and her allies continue to set their focus that peace can be achieved by smoothing relations between Israelis and Palestinians, they actually are missing the greater conflict. That is peace can never be achieved by populations who openly give their allegiance to religious tyrannical decrees. It is negotiating apples and oranges. The truth is Religious Tyranny is the real threat to world security, not the Israeli Palestinian conflict. No matter how much Israel is pressured to make peace or give up land, the issue can never be resolved. It is a diversion, a really, really dangerous diversion that will cost Israel its existence. For all practical purposes, the baton for peace in the Middle East that has been passed down by every president and has become nothing but a truncheon used for Israel's destruction. After more than 40 years of fruitless dialogue with the Arab states, the vultures of death are now circling Israel and she is boxed in on all sides. We need to unite and take up the call for an immediate end to negotiations with people who have become nothing more than foot soldiers in Iran's global terrorist enterprise. Whether it is PLO, Hamas, or Fatah, they are one in the same. Call them religious terrorists or secular moderates, the DNA of hate and the destruction of Israelis is the glue that binds these political parties to a common objective. Their focus and determination is to create another terrorist Islamic state with We will not stand idly by as this crisis among Americaâ € ™ s youth grows and evolves, and we will continue monitoring the situation and take further actions as necessary, â €  Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. Companies that don't stop making and distributing the restricted products within 30 days risk penalties by the FDA, including fines and seizures. Incoming FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said the government's approach attempts to balance the problem of underage vaping with â € œthe potential role that e-cigarettes may play in helping adult smokers transition completely awayâ €  from regular cigarettes. But the decision to permit menthol and exempt tank-based vapes was immediately condemned by anti-tobacco advocates who have lobbied the Trump administration to follow through on its initial pledge to ban all flavours except tobacco. â € œOnly the elimination of all flavoured e-cigarettes can end the worsening youth e-cigarette epidemic and stop e-cigarette companies from luring and addicting kids with flavoured products, â €  said Matthew Myers, of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, in a statement. Myers' group and others have long opposed all flavours in tobacco products, including menthol in traditional cigarettes. They argue that teenagers who vape will simply shift to using menthol if it remains on the market. When Trump officials first sketched out their plans at a White House event in September they specifically said menthol would be banned. But that effort stalled after vaping proponents and lobbyists pushed back and White House advisers told Trump that a total flavour ban could cost him votes. Industry groups including the Vapor Technology Association launched an aggressive social media campaign -- #IVapeIVote -- contending that the plan would force the closure of vaping shops, eliminating jobs and sending users of electronic cigarettes back to traditional smokes. Trump's initial announcement came amid an outbreak of unexplained lung illnesses tied to vaping. But since then health officials have tied the vast majority of the cases to a contaminating filler added to illicit THC vaping liquids. THC is the chemical in marijuana that makes users feel high. Makers of legal nicotine-based vaping products hav"
Q473239," I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals,' he also said. It is unclear whether Pompeo will comply with the committee's request for documents by October 4. Three committees of the Democratic-led House of Representatives have scheduled depositions with five current and former State Department officials over the next two weeks. In issuing a separate subpoena last week, the chairmen of the committees warned that stonewalling their probe would be considered obstruction of Congress in its impeachment inquiry. The impeachment inquiry was prompted by a whistle-blower's account that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, currently a Democratic front-runner in next year's presidential election. The whistle-blower's complaint cited a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy during which the U.S. president allegedly pushed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company when his father worked in then-President Barack Obama's administration. No evidence of wrongdoing has surfaced regarding either of the Bidens. The Trump-Zelenskiy phone call came shortly after the United States withheld almost $400 million in military funding to Ukraine, causing concern that the president was using the aid approved by Congress as a bargaining chip for his personal advantage. Trump denied any wrongdoing. Speaking to reporters on October 1, Zelenskiy insisted that `it is impossible to put pressure on me.' The Ukrainian president said he had stressed the importance of the U.S. military aid repeatedly in discussions with Trump, adding that `it wasn't explained to me' why the money didn't come through until September. Zelenskiy also said he has never met or spoken with Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who has confirmed that he contacted the Ukrainian authorities about possibly investigating Biden and his son.

Q22212," Saying so brings me no joy. I have supported the Saudi regime for years, and I agree with President Trump that Saudi Arabia remains a strategic ally. Yet it is not too much to ask an ally not to abuse civilized norms, and the extra judicial killing of a journalist in a diplomatic facility is nothing if not uncivilized. I also take issue with Mr. Pompeo's charge that criticism of Saudi Arabia in the U.S. comes from the Obama `echo chamber' that supported the horrendous Iran nuclear deal. I never supported the nuclear deal, nor have I coddled the Iranian regime. I've made it clear that the ayatollah and his henchman are religious Nazis. Iran is destructive, destabilizing and hostile to the interest of America and its allies. The missiles Iran provides to the Houthis in Yemen pose a real threat to Saudi cities, freedom of navigation, and regional stability. No one's hands are clean in the suffering of the Yemeni people, least of all Iran. But left unchecked, Saudi Arabia's recent behavior will help Iran by driving a wedge between the U.S. and our other Mideast allies. Lebanon, Jordan and others need assurance that America won't bend to the whims of the crown prince. He is a wrecking ball to U.S. -- Saudi relations. Given the evidence U.S. intelligence has gathered on Khashoggi's killing, denying the crown prince's involvement amounts to willful blindness. Failing to censure him would give a green light to murder their critics.

We're running out of time. McMaster said that yesterday. I'm going to urge the Pentagon not to send any more dependents to South Korea. South Korea should be an unaccompanied tour. It's crazy to send spouses and children to South Korea given the provocation of North Korea, so I want them to stop sending dependents. I think it's now time to start moving American dependents out of South Korea... The intelligence community can tell you that better than I can but I have an extensive discussion with the administration about this topic. The policy of the Trump administration is to deny North Korea the capability to hit America with a nuclear-tipped missile, not to contain it. That now means preemptive war as a last result. That preemption is becoming more likely as their technology matures. Every missile test, every underground test of a nuclear weapon means the marriage is more likely. I think we're really running out of time. The Chinese are trying, but ineffectively. If there's an underground nuclear test, then you need to get ready for a very serious response by the United States. I don't want people in South Carolina paying for a hole in the ground. We've had nine rate increases to pay for these power plants. There are other companies out there that can partner to build these plants. I'm going to work with the governor and the president, try to convince him that if you do not build these three power plants, that's the end of the nuclear renaissance in America, and that would be a loss for this country. Why can the French build a power plant? The Russians and the Chinese build power plants, and we can't? It tells you a lot about the erosion of the industrial base.

Q24313," where the virus first emerged late last year, and which has suffered the vast majority of infections -- by imposing travel controls and shutting down public events. Italy on Saturday saw its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases since the outbreak began in the north of the country on Feb. 21. In its daily update, Italy's civil protection agency said the number of people with the coronavirus rose by 1,247 in the last 24 hours, taking the total to 5,883. Another 36 people also died as a result of the virus, taking the total to 233. There was chaos and confusion in the northern Italian city of Padua in the Veneto region as word spread late Saturday evening that the government was planning to announce the quarantine. Packed bars and restaurants quickly emptied out as many people rushed to the train station in Padua. Travellers with suitcases, wearing face masks, gloves and carrying bottles of sanitizing gel shoved their way on to trains. Before Conte signed the quarantine decree, Stefano Bonaccini, president of the Emilia Romagna region, said parts of the decree were confusing, and he asked the premier for more time to come up with solutions that were more â € œcoherent. â €  Around the world, events and festivals have been called off. Travel restrictions and warnings have been issued. A nose-dive in tourist traffic and possible disruptions to supply chains have set off fears of a worldwide economic slowdown. Benchmarks in global markets have gyrated in recent weeks, as hopes for stimulus measures mixed with widespread pessimism on the virus news. Saudi Arabia has banned spectators at any sports competitions starting Saturday. The NBA, as well as British and Japanese sports teams are considering the same, as baseball and soccer seasons are starting. The spread of the virus has also taken a psychological toll. Authorities and manufacturers have been trying to assure panicking consumers they donâ € ™ t need to hoard toilet paper, which have vanished from store shelves in various nations. A particular point of concern are passenger-packed cruise ships, many of which are confronting their own virus problems. Officials in California were deciding Saturday where to dock the Grand Princess cruise ship, after 21 tested positive for the virus. There is evidence the ship now idling off San Francisco was the breeding ground for a deadly cluster of almost 20 cases during an earlier voyage. â € œThose that will need to be quarantined will be quarantined, I would have a message to faith communities across the country and first and foremost it would be a word of gratitude. Our churches and synagogues and communities of faith across America have risen to the challenge. I talked to my mom this morning. She had a neighbor who was bringing over some fresh groceries, it would be impossible to fully describe what faith communities, even during a time of social distancing and not even being able to meet, have still been putting hands and feet on their faith. And it's one of the reasons the President and I have taken efforts to remind every American as I do so again, that even if you're not in the pew on Sunday, that ministry is still going on. And so to the extent that you're able to continue to contribute to your local church, your local synagogue, your ministry, we encourage you to that because those communities of faith are making such an immense difference. And we are also grateful that most communities of faith around the country have heeded the President's Coronavirus guidelines for America and avoided gatherings of more than 10. And those who would, as we go into this very precious Easter weekend might think otherwise, I would just remind as a brother in Christ that where two or more are gathered, there He is also and this weekend my wife and I will gather in the living room at the Vice President's residence, we'll watch our home church, College Park in Indiana, and then after that we're going to have a Skype Easter brunch with our kid around the country. We're all making do. But we can still worship, we can still practice our faith and the really important social distancing that at this time, in the life of our nation is just so important. Yesterday the April revenue forecast showed that the State of Indiana will have approximately $213 million less than was estimated in December for the upcoming 2016-2017 budget. While this forecast confirms the importance of fiscal discipline, it should be noted that the revised forecast still projects modest revenue growth. I believe that education should be our top priority for those new dollars. If we are to have 100,000 more students in B or better schools by 2020, we must fund excellence in education at every level for all of Indiana's kids and provide more equitable funding for every child in every school. As my budget proposal demonstrated, we can provide additional resources for traditional public schools, increase the amount of funding for each charter school student, supp"
Q355522," This new strategy announced by the president to contain Iran's regional ambitions, its malign conduct and efforts to dominate the broader Middle East is an appropriate response to the consequences of the Obama Administration's failed policies. The Obama Administration's determination to draw down America's conventional military presence from across the globe, avoid conflict with competitor nation states even when those same countries threatened our national security interests, and its drive to negotiate an agreement with Iran that left a state sponsor of terror with an internationally recognized nuclear enrichment program was simply inadequate. The president's decision not to certify that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is `in the vital national security interests of the United States' now provides the opportunity for Congress to strengthen the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act and create a standard for certification that is consistent with our interests. And it makes clear to our allies that more work must be done to contain Iran's malign behavior. I am committed to working with the Trump Administration to constrain Iran's support for terrorism and proxy militias, impede the threat of ballistic missiles and deny Iran the path to a nuclear weapon. Strengthening the criteria attached to a presidential certification is solely within the powers of the American government and based on making the verification of the JCPOA more in keeping with our national interests. An element of this new approach to Iran is to recognize that our strategy must be based on the national security interests of the United States, such as preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, countering terrorism and preserving our security and that of our allies. This overall approach to staunch Iranian aggression cannot be held hostage to the JCPOA. For too long the Obama Administration ignored Iranian harassment of U.S. naval ships in the Persian Gulf, efforts of Shia militias to create a land bridge through Iraq and Syria to Hezbollah and the arming of the Houthis in Yemen. The Trump Administration now has the opportunity to work with the Congress and our allies to respond appropriately to these actions. Since November 8, this Governor has consistently promised the sky and delivered the rain. He pledged to our citizens that he would balance a budget without raising taxes. He did not. He pledged to our citizens that he would step up and handle his own outstanding tax burden. He has not. He pledged to the Legislature that he would deliver a budget that would make the kinds of tough cuts that would be needed to get this state back on a course to prosperity. He has not. He said he had found the money necessary to prevent a `raid' on the Rainy Day fund. He has not. While the House and Senate met on the floor for the 42nd day in a row, our Governor held another press conference to complain about the Legislature, make threats, and scare the public into believing the sun will not rise if the Legislature will not grant him his massive $450 million tax increase. Today, while the Legislature continued its work, the Governor called us cowards, described his meetings with legislative leadership as producing `nothing,' threatened to shut down the government outright if he does not get his way, and, perhaps in the most out-of-touch move to date, declared his intent to turn on the State of Emergency lantern in the top of the Capitol dome. In further drawing his line in the sand, he said he would be downstairs every morning in his `war room,' and the Legislature could come to him to work. There is no question about it: This Governor has declared war on the taxpayers of the state of West Virginia by demanding that they absorb the costs of his desire to grow government. Governor Justice has repeatedly asked both the public and the Legislature to `trust him,' and to `judge him by his deeds.' The deeds this Governor today show a person who is dangerously unprepared to lead this state, and someone who has a deep disrespect for constitutional government and the hardworking, taxpaying citizens who elected him. This Legislature will not stand by and allow the taxpayers to be used as collateral, or to be disrespected any longer. Once again, we are urgently requesting that Senate leadership postpone any proceedings on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court until a thorough FBI investigation into the multiple allegations of sexual assault and misconduct has been completed. We have heard credible allegations from three women -- Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez, and Julie Swetnick -- who bravely shared their traumatizing experiences of sexual assault and misconduct at the hands of Judge Kavanaugh. We urge you to give these allegations the respect and seriousness they deserve.

Republicans press for fast action on Coronavirus stimulus measure Senate Republicans vowed on Thursday to work through the weekend to approve a sweeping plan to boost the economy in the face of massive losses tied to the Coronavirus outbreak, as GOP leaders proposed direct payments to American families mixed with tax breaks for businesses and billions of dollars in emergency loans for the airline industry. `This legislation is a significant next step,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. `And the Senate is not going anywhere until we take action.' The GOP plan includes small business `interruption loans,' direct payments to Americans - which are labeled 2020 `recovery rebates,' delays in employer payroll tax payments, estimated business tax payments, a variety of tax changes, a suspension of certain aviation taxes, and much more-all crammed into 247 page bill unveiled on Thursday afternoon. `The time to act is now,' said Sen.

Ships crew would be in charge of food service, cleaning and normal operations. Government and hospitals would be in charge of the medical side, the Post reported. The company said the ships can be transformed into up to 1,000 hospital rooms that could be equipped with remote patient monitoring technology that could monitor cardiac function, respiratory function and oxygen levels. The ships could also be isolated by deck for multiple medical functions, the company said. This would not be out of the ordinary to transform from catering to vacationers to helping the country during times of emergency. Ocean liners were drafted into service during World War I and World War II as troop transports, stripping the ships of their high-class amenities to basic necessities, USA Today reported.

Q2036942," So to every Democratic Senator, they are facing a choice, do you value the safety and security of the United States of America? Do you value standing with our friend and ally, the nation of Israel? Do you value the lives of millions of Americans? Or do you value more party loyalty to the Obama White House. To every Democratic Senator who said he or she will support this deal, I ask you to consider how will you look in the eyes of the mothers and fathers of our soldiers, the hundreds of soldiers, American soldiers who were murdered in Iraq with Iranian IED's that came from General Sulamani. This deal lifts sanctions on General Sulamani. Tell me how you look a mom in the eyes and say I voted to lift sanctions on the man who murdered your son when he was defending this nation. But beyond that, when we talk about terrorism, it's worth remembering that if this deal goes through, we know to an absolute certainty, people will die. Americans will die, Israelis will die, Europeans will die. Osama bin Laden never had $100 billion. He was filled with hatred and using rudimentary tools, murdered nearly 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001. We're now talking about giving the Ayatollah today, a homicidal maniac who hates America as much as bin Laden did, giving him $100 billion to carry out his murderous plan. I want to ask every Senate Democrat how will you look in the eyes of the mother or father or son or daughters of those who are murdered by jihadists, those Americans who were blown up, those Americans who were shot, those Americans who were killed, those Israelis who were murdered. And let me be clear, if you vote to send billions of dollars to jihadists who have pledged to murder Americans, then you bear direct responsibility for the murders carried out with the dollars you have given them. You cannot wash your hands of that blood. Well, listen, you can do both, and that's one of the things American foreign policy has long recognized is that you can pursue more than one objective at one time. So, or example, when Russia invaded Ukraine, at the time I called on President Obama to do two things. Number one, to install the anti-ballistic missile batteries that had been scheduled to go into Poland and the Czech Republic. Obama and Secretary Clinton had canceled that in 2009, in an effort to appease Putin.... And the appeasement didn't work. That would have been a powerful statement of america standing with our allies. You know, I met with a number of conservative EU members who were in town yesterday, and we were talking about exactly this issue. And it was striking that all across Europe, the members who were here were nodding and saying that would have had a powerful impact on underscoring that America stands with our allies. And then the second thing that we should have done at that time, is there were then 22 applications pending in the federal government to export liquid natural gas. President Obama should have held a national TV conference and said I'm approving every one of them right now today. Now, it would have taken some time for those to process through and flow out, but the effect of that would have threefold. Number one, it would have helped the people of Ukraine and Europe stand free from Putin's economic blackmail that he uses energy to blackmail them. Number two, it would have hit Putin where it hurts, in the pocketbook. And number three, it would have created jobs and economic growth here. Now, that's an example where we can press back against Russian aggression, but doing that is not inconsistent at the same time when you have a malevolent force like ISIS, working with them where our interests coincide. 60% of Americans have a negative view of Donald Trump. It's why the Democrats are so thrilled for our country to nominate him. I will say there was a very disturbing story that broke today that apparently there is a secret tape that The New York Times editorial board has of Donald Trump saying that he doesn't believe what he's saying on immigration. That all of his promises to secure the border are not real and if he's president, he doesn't intend to do what he says. Now, that's been reported that The New York Times apparently has this on tape but it was an off the record tape. The New York Times has said they will not release the tape unless Donald gives them permission to do so. I call on Donald, ask The New York Times to release the tape and do so today before the Super Tuesday primary. There are one of two instances: It is either false. If Donald didn't say that to New York Times, then he deserves to have this cleared up and releasing the tape can clear it up. The alternative is that it is true and that not only did Donald Trump fund the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer amnesty effort, and not only did he give over $50,000 to 5 of the 8 members of the Gang of Eight -- but that he actually, now, is telling New York Times editorial board: `Pay no attention to what I'm saying on immigration because I, "
Q10390," President Trump has committed to eliminating the defense sequester and rebuilding the military. There are two main tasks. The first is modernizing the military for the new realities of deterring conflict and competing with great powers that possess advanced capabilities. For too long, the U.S. has taken for granted that its forces could operate anywhere and dominate any environment with minimal effort. That assumption no longer holds. However, with greater investments in technology such as hypersonic munitions and artificial intelligence, the military can become much more capable over the next five years. The second priority is regaining capacity for the military to perform its current missions at acceptable levels of risk. Today the armed forces simply do not have enough ships, aircraft, vehicles, munitions, equipment and personnel. Adding capacity alone is not the answer, and increasing capacity, especially personnel, must be done deliberately and sustainably. But this is a yearslong process that should begin immediately. The military has to become not only bigger but more efficient. There is room to cut wasteful spending at the Defense Department. And patience remains important: The harm that has been done to the military over eight years will not be reversed quickly. U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump is causing controversy -- again.

I strongly believe that children who were illegally brought into this country through no fault of their own should not be forced to return to a country they do not know. The 800,000 innocent young people granted deferred action under DACA over the last several years are pursuing degrees, starting careers, and contributing to our communities in important ways. While I disagreed with President Obama's unilateral action on this issue, I believe that rescinding DACA at this time is an unacceptable reversal of the promises and opportunities that have been conferred to these individuals. The federal government has a responsibility to defend and secure our borders, but we must do so in a way that upholds all that is decent and exceptional about our nation. I will be working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to devise and pass comprehensive immigration reform, which will include the DREAM Act. It's embarrassing that the leader of the free world says an obviously failed strategy, particularity in light -- now we know ISIS has nearly global reach -- that things are going fine. That his quote strategy, and by the way, I never heard that strategy articulated, is succeeding. It's embarrassing when he says people who disagree with him quote pop off. Does that mean Mike Morell his former deputy head of the CIA who says his strategy is not working, is that David Petraeus who has come forward with a proposal on the no-fly zones to stop the barrel problems, people like General Keane, architect of the surge, are these people all just popping off? Then it's embarrassing when he continues to set up a straw man saying there is either nothing done or 100,000 troops. No one I know of is recommending 100,000 troops. We are recommending an international coalition of Arab and European countries with about ten thousand America troops. But for him to stand there for 45 minute and allege the status quo is fine and we are making progress. I just hope we don't make more progress.

Q358443," After a two-month delay, the Department of Justice's Inspector General, its internal watchdog, has published a memorandum finding that the practices of sanctuary jurisdictions violate federal law. This opinion must bring an end to the excuses proffered by numerous Democratic leaders to defend the extreme and dangerous practices of sanctuary jurisdictions. It is particularly frustrating that this memorandum was initially wrongfully marked as being `Law Enforcement Sensitive,' and therefore not made available to the public. Notably, this memorandum was dated prior to a key Senate vote on Senator Toomey's sanctuary jurisdiction legislation just a few weeks ago -- legislation that would have ended this dangerous practice. Only two Democrats supported the legislation, all while this memorandum that makes clear the illegality of these policies was withheld from the public discourse. It is a simple fact that aliens lawfully here, and of course those unlawfully here, must be deported promptly upon their conviction for criminal offenses. Failure to do so places whole communities at risk, especially immigrant communities in those sanctuary jurisdictions. Yet the Obama Administration has been totally ineffective in confronting these policies that dramatically undermine the enforcement of our immigration laws. Too often, we have heard comments such as `sanctuary cities have a place in America' to justify this unjustifiable practice. The Obama Administration has a plain duty to cut off law enforcement funds to any jurisdiction that violates this responsibility to ensure the deportation of criminal aliens. The Inspector General's decision is sound and firmly settles the question. Now, the law and the American people demand that this Administration cease its acquiescence in this illegality. The Obama Administration must immediately take action to withhold significant federal law enforcement funding for these offending jurisdictions. First, I am announcing a new data analytics program -- the Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit. I have created this unit to focus specifically on opioid-related health care fraud using data to identify and prosecute individuals that are contributing to this opioid epidemic. This sort of data analytics team can tell us important information about prescription opioids -- like which physicians are writing opioid prescriptions at a rate that far exceeds their peers; how many of a doctor's patients died within 60 days of an opioid prescription; the average age of the patients receiving these prescriptions; pharmacies that are dispensing disproportionately large amounts of opioids; and regional hot spots for opioid issues. With this data in hand, I am also assigning 12 experienced prosecutors to focus solely on investigating and prosecuting opioid-related health care fraud cases in a dozen locations around the country where we know enforcement will make a difference in turning the tide on this epidemic. These prosecutors, working with FBI, DEA, HHS, as well as our state and local partners, will help us target and prosecute these doctors, pharmacies, and medical providers who are furthering this epidemic to line their pockets. These prosecutors will be based in several states across the country, including Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee, and right here in Southern Ohio. With these new resources, we will be better positioned to identify, prosecute, and convict some of the individuals contributing to these tens of thousands of deaths a year. The Department is determined to attack this opioid epidemic, and I believe these resources will make a difference. Today, a federal court entered a consent decree that will require the court and a highly-paid monitor to govern every detail of how the Baltimore Police Department functions for the foreseeable future. This decree was negotiated during a rushed process by the previous administration and signed only days before they left office. While the Department of Justice continues to fully support police reform in Baltimore, I have grave concerns that some provisions of this decree will reduce the lawful powers of the police department and result in a less safe city. Make no mistake, Baltimore is facing a violent crime crisis. Baltimore has seen a 22 percent increase in violent crime in just the last year. While arrests in the city fell 45 percent based on some of these ill-advised reforms, homicides rose 78 percent and shootings more than doubled. Just in 2017, we've seen homicides are up another 42 percent compared to this time last year. In short, the citizens of Baltimore are plagued by a rash of violent crime that shows no signs of letting up. The mayor and police chief in Baltimore say they are committed to better policing and that there should be no delay to review this decree, but there are clear departures from many proven principles of good policing that we fear will result in more crime. The citizens of Baltimore deserve to see a real and lasting "
Q11668," The monster who was responsible for these attacks has no conscience... The Russian regime, whose hands are all covered in the blood of Syrian children, cannot be shamed by pictures of its victims. We've tried that before... Russia's obstructionism will not continue to hold us hostage when we are confronted with an attack like this one... Russia and Iran have military advisers at the Assad regime's airfields and operations centers. Russian officials are on the ground helping direct the regime's `starve and surrender' campaigns, and Iranian allied forces do much of the dirty work. When the Syrian military pummels civilians, they rely on the military hardware given by Russia. Russia could stop this senseless slaughter if it wanted. But it stands with the Assad regime and supports it without hesitation. The United States is determined to see the monster who dropped chemical weapons on the Syrian people held to account... We must not overlook Russia and Iran's roles in enabling the Assad regime's murderous destruction... We are beyond showing pictures of dead babies. History will record this as the moment when the Security Council either discharged its duty or demonstrated its utter and complete failure to protect the people of Syria... Either way, the United States will respond. China is working strategically to spread its financial and military presence across the globe-and not in a good way. China steals intellectual property. It helps North Korea cheat on sanctions, Haley said. The Chinese manipulate their currency in ways that poison our trade relationship, she said, adding that they are enlarging their military at a rapid pace. A good example of the difference between the threat posed by free versus unfree governments is two of the largest - and fastest-growing economies in the world: India and China, Haley wrote in the book. In her book, being promoted by US President Donald Trump on Twitter, the two-term Governor of South Carolina said that in addition to being a bad economic actor and a strategic threat, the Chinese government is one of the greatest human rights abusers in the world, she alleged. In their own country, it has created re-education camps against an ethnic and religious minority, and an Orwellian surveillance state to protect Communist Party control over its people, Everything's not black and white. That's the hard part. But the way we have to look at that is, we have worked very closely with Saudi Arabia on Yemen, really pushing them to allow humanitarian access -- to move faster, to give more. That's been a lot of our focus at the Security Council on what happened. The whole situation with Khashoggi is, we can't give them a pass. We can't. And the reason is, you have Saudi government officials that did this in a Saudi consulate. The Saudi government doesn't get a pass. We can't condone it, we can't ever say it's okay, we can't ever support thuggish behavior, and we have to say that. I think that the main thing is: No, we don't condone this; no, we're not going to continue to be your partners if you continue to use thuggish behavior. But you know what? That country is our complete partner when it comes to fighting Iran, and our only real partner when it comes to fighting Iran, so it's a balancing act, but you have to do both. That's a loaded question. You know the world has changed and the threats have increased. But we're dealing with it. And you know that's something that's been interesting to see how it just started with like one issue and now they're just popping up everywhere. But the United States is on it. We're focused. We're going to always work towards protection of civilians and to make sure we're bringing peace and security. And that's going to continue to be our focus.... For me, it's what a learning curve it's been. Really, going from domestic policy to foreign policy. It's a complete shift. But I have enjoyed it. It's everyday I'm learning. But I love it. It's really been enlightening. Just to find out so many things about so many places in the world. And so many issues. And the ability to negotiate with other foreign leaders on these things. It's been really fantastic. We've had another three or four this week. Our tourism numbers last week were four percent over where they were last year. So those things are going well. From the flood perspective, the Department of Employment and Workforce went in and they offered unemployment to anyone who lost their job or lost money during the flood, but they're also giving money to small business owners. And the beauty of that is they're not punishing the small businesses for that. So, we just took another cut, unemployment tax cut, which is great, $150 million dollars for our small businesses. That will give them more cash flow to hire more people and we hit 5.7 percent unemployment which is the lowest since 2008. So, we're going to be okay. That doesn't mean we don't have more work to do, we do. But I think where we are right now is"
Q463557," So we examine that, my wife and I did a great deal of research and we examined Scandinavian socialism and what we came up with is interestingly they are not socialist. They have private property; most of the businesses are owned privately. They have a private stock exchange. In fact, the prime minister of Denmark when Bernie kept saying, `Denmark is this great socialist nation,' the prime minister actually came out and said, `Bernie, you need to pipe down; we're not a socialist country.' In fact, he almost got alarm in his voice because he was worried people might not come there to do business anymore because they might think they were a socialist nation. Most of the indexes of freedom, trade, and capitalism actually rank the Scandinavian countries quite high. So really what Bernie is selling is a bill of goods here. They will then argue that the Scandinavian countries have a lot of free stuff -- they do have a lot of free stuff, welfare, and state goodies that come with big government, but the interesting thing with Scandinavia is it's much different than Bernie and AOC say. What happens in Scandinavia is the working class pay a huge amount of taxes. The working class pay a 25 percent sales tax on everything, including food, and the working class and middle class also pay income tax, whereas many in our country on the lower end are excluded from the income tax, whereas what you find over there is even at $60,000 you have a 60 percent income tax. So, really, I think it's important that we explode the myths of American socialists that Scandinavia is socialist but also explode the myth that you can have all this free stuff and the only people that pay are the top one percent in America. There's just not enough money, and it's just not true. would be a complete annual audit looking back at the previous year. Basically it would be an audit of all aspects of the Fed, including what they own. Probably one of the more startling things is the Fed will say that they are already audited, and that is kind of disingenuous, is the best way you can put it. The GAO auditor was before a House committee a few years ago, and they say, `Well, you're the auditor and you perform the audit,' and she said yes, and they said, `Well, what does the Fed own? They have $4.5 trillion of assets -- what are these assets?' and they said, `Oh, we don't audit that.' It is like, what do you audit, how much coffee they purchased, what their salaries are, their expenses? It is kind of ridiculous and really unfair to say they are audited, when an audit would be what are your activities, what do you buy and sell, and what are they really worth? Because I think for the confidence of the nation, we would want to know what their assets are worth, are they marked-to-market, who did they buy them from, what did they pay for them. And we've had an audit before. We had an audit after the crisis in 2008, and we learned some startling things, but the world didn't end. It would be a complete audit of everything they do -- including what they purchase, what they buy, what they sell. And I think that is not unreasonable to ask. And, really, the only constituency in the country opposed to it is the Federal Reserve. But, they are the ultimate of insiders, and they have a great deal of influence in Washington, so every year they come and basically mislead Congress by saying, `Oh, we already have audit,' which is not really true. We believe that the message of `leave me alone' that forms sort of the `leave me alone coalition' forms this group of people that we think supports the things I'm trying to do is a big enough and broad enough coalition to win in a Republican primary but is also a big enough and broad enough to bring independents and others afterwards. There are two different tactics you could try to do if you want to bring in independents: You could be Democrat-light and run the Jeb Bush campaign that's uncomfortable with the grassroots of your party and you could run this campaign that's like `I'm almost like Hillary Clinton but not quite' and then you can get the independents or I think you could run a truly principled campaign as a Constitutional conservative but also still show how the message that big government messes everything up from business to taxes to regulation also can be applied to criminal justice. That big government messes up criminal justice and doesn't treat people fairly because big government is incompetent. Big government is incapable of feting out justice sometimes because it is too large. So I think there is a possibility, a great possibility, a truly principled Constitutional limited government conservative message, could resonate out to a bigger audience. We try to take it everywhere. We also try to go where Republicans haven't been going, to the tech community, to historically black colleges, to Berkeley, to places like that with a hope of showing that we can broaden the message. That's what people will want if we're the no"

As a former federal prosecutor I'm only person running for president who knows how this works and could do this the right way in the White House. The fact is first we need to know is why did she have a private email server and why did she conducting all government business over that server?... The law says you are supposed to conduct official business over a government server so you can protect the secrets of the Untied States. That is the second piece of this, how did she handle classified information? David Petraeus was prosecuted for this, Sandy Berger was prosecuted for this, Hillary Clinton very well may be prosecuted for this. And at the least the FBI should be aggressively investigating her and I believe that is what they are doing today. The fact is that Mrs. Clinton's arrogance is rooted in this idea that she doesn't want to answer any questions. Answer questions. Why did you have a private email server? This isn't like asking a private email account on Google or Facebook or Yahoo to be able to email with your children or with your spouse. This is having a private email server, your own server. And after it's been subpoenaed by the House of Representatives she deletes the emails, that is obstruction of justice. I told him about the night he played Sandy at the Continental Arena. My 6 year old son Andrew and I were in the front row on tix we won in the KACF auction. Bruce had thrown him a pick earlier in the evening and acknowledged his energy at 11 PM during Land of Hope and Dreams. (He said, looking at my six year old son, `He's still going?' ) He then introduced Sandy by pointing to my son and saying `We're gon na send you home with a little lullaby.' As I finished this story in the jetway, Bruce said, `That was your little guy?' I said yes and told him how much it meant to my son (he'll still calls Sandy `his' song) and how much it meant to me. He said he remebered [ sic ] and called Andrew `crazy' with a big grin and chuckle. He told me to tell Andrew he was glad he had such a good time and to come back again. I then asked Bruce if he could sign an autograph to Andrew and his 3 year old sister Sarah Anne (who had also been to 2 shows -- one in Philly and one in Jersey). He was happy to do it and signed to both of them. He shook my hand, told my wife to make sure the kids got the autograph and wished us a Merry Christmas. His ride was waiting at the gate and he walked away. What an incredible time for me, a Bruce fan since 1976. Because he and this president have ushered in the weakest recovery from a recession since World War II. So, yeah, he's right the economy is not what it should be, and that jobs are not created at the rates they should be because we have a government that over taxes, overregulates and thinks that all decisions need to be made in Washington, D.C., Harold. And you got the president yesterday on Labor Day standing up for all his public sector union friends, where he wasted all the money on the stimulus package on and he's criticizing me and Scott Walker yesterday. I'll tell you this, I have no regrets for taking on the public sector unions. You know, you saw the story, Joe, a teacher in New Jersey who was at, who was late over 100 times in two years -- the teacher's union stands up and protects that person.

Q331401," So we're getting a lot of evidence that these sanctions are really starting to hurt. And so the rapprochement of the North to the South, now they're on to the playbook that you know as well as anyone. And the playbook is, okay, we're going to start our charm offensive to the rest of the world and let them see we're just normal people like everybody else. We're going to engender some sympathy. We're going to try to drive a wedge between South Korea and their allies. And we spent an extraordinary amount of time yesterday in the group discussion hearing from Foreign Minister Kang of South Korea about how they're not going to let that happen. So we understand what this is about, and we've been supportive of this rapprochement, because the other element of the diplomacy is we've been waiting for Kim to decide he wants to talk. We've been very clear, and our channels are open. And as I said yesterday in my press avail, he knows how to reach me if he wants to talk. But he's got to tell me he wants to talk. We're not going to chase him. So this may be their early effort to break the ice; we'll see. Nothing may come of it, but -- we are supportive of that, but I would tell you that among the allies in the region, but equally with China, I don't think we have ever been as unified against this threat. Because China knows the potential consequences of this, to unintended consequences that could come later. And in diplomacy, where you're dealing with someone across the table like this, and when we get to that negotiating table -- and I'm confident we will -- I want to know that Secretary Mattis has a very, very strong military option standing behind me. That will give me a better position from which to try to solve this. Trump has at times questioned the purpose of further talks with the North after years of negotiations by previous U.S. administrations failed to halt the North's weapons programmes. Last year, North Korea conducted dozens of missile launches and its sixth and largest nuclear test in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions as it pursues its goal of developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States. Relations between the two Koreas have improved in recent weeks, with Pyongyang sending its highest ranking delegation ever to attend the Winter Olympic Games, being held in the South Korean resort of Pyeongchang. The visit included an invitation for South Korean President Moon Jae-in to travel to Pyongyang for talks. Such a meeting, if it came about, would mark the first inter-Korea summit since 2007. A South Korean government official said Seoul's stance was that separate talks with North Korea by South Korea and the United States should both lead to the denuclearisation of the North while sanctions and pressure continue to be applied. North Korea defends its weapons programmes as essential to counter U.S. aggression, saying regular war drills between the United States and the South are preparations for invasion. The South hosts 28,500 U.S. troops, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war. FAMILY TIES South Korea said it would seek ways to continue engaging North Korea, including trying to arrange more reunions for families divided by the war and lowering military tensions. The statement from the Ministry of Unification came after the North Korean delegation concluded its three-day visit. The United States strongly condemns North Korea's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Testing an ICBM represents a new escalation of the threat to the United States, our allies and partners, the region, and the world. Global action is required to stop a global threat. Any country that hosts North Korean guest workers, provides any economic or military benefits, or fails to fully implement UN Security Council resolutions is aiding and abetting a dangerous regime. All nations should publicly demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to their pursuit of nuclear weapons. We intend to bring North Korea's provocative action before the UN Security Council and enact stronger measures to hold the DPRK accountable. The United States seeks only the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the end of threatening actions by North Korea. As we, along with others, have made clear, we will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea. The President and his national security team are continuing to assess the situation in close coordination with our allies and partners. Iran has not been successful; the Russian government has been more successful. We have had success. I don't think that Iran should be given credit for the defeat of ISIS in Syria. Russia-backed Syrian government forces as well as U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led troops have recently significantly reduced territory controlled by IS across Syria. The U.S.-backed forces recently ousted IS from their so-called capital, Raqqa. Tillerson met with de Mistura during a stop in Geneva on his way home from a trip to the Middle East and S"
Q439729," Hurricane Irma is a major and life-threatening storm and Florida must be prepared. I have continued to be briefed by the Florida Division of Emergency Management on Hurricane Irma and current forecast models have Florida in Irma's path -- potentially impacting millions of Floridians. Today, given these forecasts and the intensity of this storm, I have declared a state of emergency for every county in Florida to make certain that state, federal and local governments are able to work together and make sure resources are dispersed to local communities as we get prepared for this storm. In Florida, we always prepare for the worst and hope for the best and while the exact path of Irma is not absolutely known at this time, we cannot afford to not be prepared. This state of emergency allows our emergency management officials to act swiftly in the best interest of Floridians without the burden of bureaucracy or red tape. For the first time, Irma's cone of uncertainty now includes South Florida and the Florida Keyes. Hurricane Irma: Live updates Hurricane Irma continued to gain strength as it churned through the Atlantic Ocean. Tuesday's 5 a.m. advisory revealed that Irma's sustained wind strength had increased to 150 mph, making it a strong Category 4 hurricane. If Irma's sustained winds top 157 mph, it will be upgraded to a Category 5 storm. On Monday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency ahead of Hurricane Irma making landfall. The National Weather Service had upgraded the hurricane from a Category 3 to a Category 4 earlier Monday. > > Read more trending news Missing Clay teen had threatening messages sent to him on Snapchat A college-bound teenager from Clay County has been missing for more than a week. Ethan Gorden's family told Action News Jax he left his wallet at home and his phone has been silent since. Gorden, 19, is known for his caring heart and infectious smile. Gorden's mother, Maddie Gorden, told us her son disappeared from their home August 27. He stands 6' 3 I am proud to announce that the remaining Miami Beach area has been cleared of any ongoing active transmission of the Zika virus. This means that Florida does not have any identified areas with active Zika transmission, which is incredible news for the Miami Beach community and our entire state. Miami Beach attracts millions of people each year with its beautiful beaches, world-class hotels, vibrant restaurants, shops and events, and lifting this zone sends a message across the world that Miami Beach remains a top tourist destination. I encourage everyone to take an opportunity to come visit this incredible community as soon as possible and support the many businesses here. While it is disappointing that the federal government has not been a good partner in providing resources and funding to fight Zika, the State of Florida has been fully committed to doing everything we can to keep our families and visitors safe. I look forward to having a new partner in the White House who will work with us to combat the Zika virus. Since our first case of active Zika transmission, DOH has tirelessly worked alongside their many local partners and community members to educate Floridians and visitors, prevent the spread of mosquitoes, and combat the Zika virus. While today's announcement is great news, we must all remain vigilant by continuing to dump standing water and wear bug spray. We have learned a lot this year about battling Zika and the importance of using aggressive mosquito control measures and we cannot let the lifting of this final zone or the upcoming winter allow us to become complacent. We must all remain fully committed to doing our part to keep Florida clear of active Zika transmission in order to protect pregnant women and their developing babies. We must focus on finding a vaccine and enhancing our Zika testing capabilities to further protect pregnant women and their developing babies. Today, I am authorizing $25 million in state funds to support research to help develop a vaccine against the Zika virus here in Florida. I have traveled multiple times to Washington this year to meet with Congressional leaders to tell them how urgent this need is. Yet, despite endless claims of support from those within both parties, nothing has been done. Every minute that passes that Congress doesn't approve funding means more time is lost from researching this virus. For the sake of our state's future children, this is time we cannot afford to waste. Every action we take against the Zika virus is to help protect pregnant women and keep their developing babies healthy. This $25 million is a step forward for research and development in order to find a vaccine, but we still need the federal government to do their part to fully fund this mission. While I hope the federal government will recognize the dire importance of developing a vaccine and immediately pass funding, we will continue to allocate every available resource from the state. I look "

LEARN MORE & REGISTER NOW In Florida, certified medical cannabis doctors must qualify a patient for them to receive a medical cannabis treatment recommendation. For patients, having a local clinic with skilled physicians and a medical cannabis friendly environment will allow them to derive the maximum benefit from their treatments and allow our staff to gather and evaluate treatment efficacy data on an ongoing basis. In Florida, all medical cannabis patients must return to their doctor every 90 days for a check-up. For medical cannabis providers, instead of bearing the enormous costs of compliance and setting up and operating medical cannabis dispensaries with the required 24 hour security guards and heavily secured stand-alone facilities, CannaVision's certified medical cannabis doctors can assure proper medical observations and upon their recommendation our strategic medical cannabis dispensary delivers the medicine directly to the patient. Our plan is to include in a SEC registration statement the roll out of new CannaVision clinics and the roll up existing medical cannabis clinics in as many of the medical cannabis states as is practical. It is our opinion from recent public comments made by the current administration in Washington D.C. going forward medical cannabis decisions will be left to the states. If you listen to the first 14 minutes of the 15-minute press conference the director lays out a case which is very clear. It's an indictment on Hillary Clinton's judgment, on her fitness to be president. He talks about the words reckless, how there is blatant disregard for the law and the process he set out. That's what her job was. So I don't understand how you can lay out an entire case and talk about how the culture at the State Department didn't understand the importance of protecting national security, how she was reckless in handling it and not conclude there's a violation. He said we don't think this should be prosecuted. I don't understand how you can lay a case like that of all of those things and come to that conclusion. Further more, the bigger point I have that a hard time understanding is the entire reason that the secret server was set up was to intentionally evade detection, tracking, and transparency. So the motive behind doing it frankly which is one of the things that he talked about was to specifically avoid playing by the rules and following the law as set out. So I frankly don't understand how they square that circle. I would probably go with a Doug Jones down in Alabama or a Joe Manchin up in West Virginia, but I think you're right: Sinema has got to figure out what her deal is out in Arizona. I would feel less confident in her than I would in the first two. But I think you're right: one of those three is likely to vote against a removal, which gets to your point. In the House and in the Senate, you will have a bipartisan effort against this entire thing, not for it. That speaks volumes. That's why I think the Democrats are going to hav"
Q27986907," President Trump had a constructive dialogue with Democrat Leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. The President and the Democrat Leaders agreed to support the passage of historic Criminal Justice Reform, and discussed significant progress with the Farm Bill. Major disagreement remains on the issue of border security and transparency. Walls work -- where walls have been built, illegal crossings have dropped substantially. President Trump made clear that any government funding measure must include responsible border security, including a wall, to protect the American people from drugs, crime, terrorism, public health threats, and the severe straining of the social safety net. Illegal immigration is deeply unfair to American workers, wage-earners, and taxpayers -- costing billions of dollars and thousands of innocent lives. So far, the Democrat Party has made clear they would rather keep the border open than the government open. President Trump was grateful for the opportunity to let the press into the meeting so that the American People can see firsthand that while Republicans are fighting to protect our border, Democrats are fighting to protect illegal immigrants. This Administration will always put Americans first. We will continue to pursue real solutions to defend our nation and uphold our laws -- and hope Democrats will work with us in a bipartisan fashion to do so. A nation without borders is no nation at all. I can't guarantee anything, but I can tell you that the president addressed this question directly. I can tell you that I've never heard it. I can also tell you that if myself or the people that are in this building serving this country every single day -- doing our very best to help people all across this country and make it better -- if at any point we felt that the president was who some of his critics claim him to be, we certainly wouldn't be here. This is a president who is fighting for all Americans, who is putting policies in place that help all Americans -- particularly African-Americans. Just look at the economy alone. This president since he took office -- in the year-and-a-half that he's been here -- has created 700,000 new jobs for African-Americans. That's 700,000 African-Americans that are working now that weren't working when this president took place. When President Obama left after eight years in office -- eight years in office -- he had only created 195,000 jobs for African-Americans. President Trump in his first year-and-a-half has already tripled what President Obama did in eight years. Not only did he do that for African-Americans, but for Hispanics. 1.7 million more Hispanics are working now. This is a president who cares about all Americans, who is committed to helping them and is putting policies in place that actually do that. I think the real easy answer here is that the FBI has already said this story is B.S. Those are their words, so I apologize to my mom. But literally those are the words of the FBI, that the story is B.S.. They came to us, they approached us. We're putting that story out there. I think the American people deserve to know the truth and that's exactly what it is, that there's nothing here. Just because reporters say something over and over and over again doesn't start to make it true. At some point, we get to a place where we have got to move on and start focusing on the things that the American people care about and I don't think this is it. We've talked about it time and time and time again, asked and answered. Let's move forward. Let's start talking about the economy. Let's talk about education. Let's talk about border security. Let's talk about national security. That's what's keeping most Americans up at night. That's what they want us focused on and that's what this Administration is doing day in and day out. George, I think it's pretty safe to say, I think we all spend enough time around each other as it is. But look, this wasn't a President who was elected to spend his time with reporters and celebrities. This was a President who campaigned on speaking directly to Americans and that's exactly what he's going to spend his time doing. I think it's kind of naive of us to think we can all walk into a room for a couple of hours and pretend that some of that tension isn't there. You know, one of the things we say in the south:' if a girl scout egged your house, would you buy cookies from her?' I think this is a pretty similar scenario. There's no reason for him to go in and sit and pretend like this is going to be just another Saturday night. I think he's very focused on protecting our borders, national security, growing our economy, and instead of going and spending a night doing that, I think he'll spend the night focused on what he can do to better America. This conduct is absolutely unacceptable. It is also completely disrespectful to the reporter's colleagues not to allow them an opportunity to ask a question. President Trump has given the press"
Q69319," John Kasich's extensive experience as U.S. House Budget Committee chairman, in the private sector and as governor of one of the largest states in the nation helped him develop a keen understanding of what it takes to create opportunity, empower job creation and foster economic growth. America needs that experience. Bringing Ohio's Economy Back: When John Kasich took office as governor of Ohio in 2011, Ohio had lost 351,000 private sector jobs and was 48th in the nation in job creation. Under his leadership, however, Ohio has enacted jobs-friendly policies that have helped Ohio job-creators get back on their feet and create hundreds of thousands of new private sector jobs. Additionally, Ohio has become a top-ten state for job creation and far outperformed its own historical job creation performance. Wages are growing faster than the national average, the unemployment rate is better than the national rate and under Governor Kasich the number of new businesses created in Ohio has increased every year and is now at record high levels. The Largest Tax Cut in the Nation: Understanding that a more competitive tax environment is essential to job creation, Gov. John Kasich teamed up with Ohio's legislature to cut taxes by $5 billion since 2011 -- the largest tax cut of any sitting governor. The elimination of the death tax, a 16 percent income tax cut and a complete phase out of income taxes for small businesses will free up more capital for growth and job creation. Eliminating Wasteful Red Tape: Recognizing that unnecessary regulation stifles job creators and discourages investment, John Kasich created the Common Sense Initiative (CSI) in 2011. Charged with being a one-stop shop for reviewing regulations, CSI has so far reviewed more than 5,500 state regulations with the goal of reducing hardships that government too often places on businesses. An Innovative Approach to Economic Development: John Kasich replaced Ohio's outmoded state-run economic development system with an innovative private sector approach called JobsOhio, a non-profit organization staffed by industry experts that can move at the speed of business. An undeniable and quantifiable success, JobsOhio is positioning the state as a go-to location for aerospace, advanced manufacturing, biohealth, financial services, logistics and information technology. Well, you know, I don't know about that, but what we know is, if people violated the law here in this country, everybody that I know says they ought to be deported. In fact, it was my old colleague Bill O’Reilly who started this movement a long time ago. Look, in the very first debate, I said that Trump has touched on something, people are afraid they're going to lose their job. If they're 51 years old, they can't find a job. Their kids have too much debt. They think the system is a ripoff. They think the lobbyists control everything. So, I absolutely can understand why people are so worked up, but there's an interesting thing that Trump said. He said none of the politicians will get this done. Well, let me tell you about our state -- I'm the seventh largest state in the country, 11.5 million people. If you want a job you're likely to get one. If you're worried about your wages, ours are going up. If you have a son or a daughter that's autistic you can get insurance. What we have done in Ohio is offer specific solutions to problems and we have done it and that's why the people of the state are in such a positive mood. What Trump does is, he complains about everything -- and look -- these attacks on women and on Hillary Clinton not getting back to the stage on time, the attacks on Hispanics and Muslims. Look, we haven't started the vote yet. It's a top of the story, Trump rising and everything, wait until we start voting and then we're going to know where people are. Well, you know, my sense is when you're a government employee, or you're [ an ] elected official, I mean, I think you've got to abide by the ruling of the court. I don't -- I favor traditional marriage, Ohio actually had, in its constitution, a traditional marriage, but the court overruled it and said no.. And I've been willing to accept it. The other thing I would say, Neil, about this whole issue is that, you know, we have a lot of young people that have walked away from, or are confused or uncertain about personal faith. And one of the things that I know that's so great about it, being a flawed man, is that, thank God we have grace. So, sometimes I think people -- you know, you can have your personal views, it's how you handle them. And in this case, when young people, or people who are looking at what is religion all about, what is faith all about, when they see dust-ups like this, my concern is they go -- they would go the other way and say, `Look, I don't want anything to do with that.' So, I understand her concern. I don't agree with what her decision has been. But I also think we have bigger fish to fry in terms of the whole issue of "
Q5605224," As a former trial court judge, Texas Supreme Court Justice and Attorney General involved in prosecuting some of the most notorious criminals in Texas, I have the utmost regard for the role that juries and judges play in our legal system. The role of the Governor is not to second-guess the court process or re-evaluate the law and evidence. Instead, the Governor's role under the Constitution is distinct from the judicial function. The Governor's role is to consider recommendations by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, and view matters through a lens broader than the facts and law applied to a single case. That is particularly important in death penalty cases. In just over three years as Governor, I have allowed 30 executions. I have not granted a commutation of a death sentence until now, for reasons I here explain. The murders of Mr. Whitaker's mother and brother are reprehensible. The crime deserves severe punishment for the criminals who killed them. The recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, and my action on it, ensures Mr. Whitaker will never be released from prison. The decision of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles is supported by the totality of circumstances in this case. The person who fired the gun that killed the victims did not receive the death penalty, but Mr. Whitaker, who did not fire the gun, did get the death penalty. That factor alone may not warrant commutation for someone like Mr. Whitaker who recruited others to commit murder. Additional factors make the decision more complex. Mr. Whitaker's father, who survived the attempt on his life, passionately opposes the execution of his son. Mr. Whitaker's father insists that he would be victimized again if the state put to death his last remaining immediate family member. Also, Mr. Whitaker voluntarily and forever waived any and all claims to parole in exchange for a commutation of his sentence from death to life without the possibility of parole. Moreover, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles unanimously voted for commutation. The totality of these factors warrants a commutation of Mr. Whitaker's death sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Mr. Whitaker must spend the remainder of his life behind bars as punishment for this heinous crime. Twenty-two years ago, a young girl named Amber Hagerman was heartbreakingly abducted and murdered near her home in Arlington, Texas. While the details of the suspect were provided to law enforcement, there existed no system to quickly inform the community of Amber's disappearance. To this day, her death remains unresolved. This tragedy prompted Texas citizens to reach out to radio stations and urge the broadcast of child abduction information. Amber Hagerman is remembered and honored by the establishment of the America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response program (AMBER). Established in 2002, the Texas AMBER Alert Network provides a method to effectively disseminate an AMBER alert to any geographical area in Texas. This includes local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, as well as media to assist with rapid notification. Singe the program's inception through the end of 2017, 179 children have been safely recovered during Texas Department of Public Safety activations. The National AMBER Alert network has also helped find and safely recover more than 897 children across the country. Even with the program's success, the loss of even one child is too many. At this time, I urge all Texans to remain vigilant of the dangers present and stay informed about what to do when abduction occurs. It is important for parents, family members, friends and teachers to educate children about personal safety, in-person strangers and online strangers. Remember, if an AMBER alert has been activated, be on the lookout for the child, suspect and vehicle. If you witness an abduction or if you locate the child, suspect or possible vehicle, immediately call 911. Every passing moment is essential in the safe return of child. Therefore, I, Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas, do hereby proclaim January 13, 2018, to be AMBER Alert Awareness Day in Texas and urge the appropriate recognition whereof. Israel has no stronger ally in the United States than the state of Texas. That's true for several reasons, in part because of our personality similarities, but also in part because of our commitment to defending religious liberty [ and ] state sovereignty. There is no state -- I say with a smile -- in the country that defends state sovereignty more than Texas. And there is no country that defends state sovereignty more than the nation of Israel. As Prime Minister Netanyahu made clear to me during our meeting... Israel is the nicest house in a rough neighborhood... I am deeply disturbed by the Iran deal that was struck by President Obama. I view it as a potential existential threat to Israel and, frankly, to nations across the globe. It makes no sense to me why the United States would b"
Q6386365," She never saw it coming. Most people didn't, and these media wrote these stories that Donald Trump had a 0% chance of winning. I've got all the stories clipped, and we'll use them at some point. She knows she lost the election fairly and squarely because she was A) she was a candidate, she was overwhelming, excuse me, overestimated, underwhelming candidate who had this unbelievable fierce inability, intractable inability to connect with Americans. And contrast her to President Trump who as a candidate went out and said I'm here for the forgotten man and forgotten woman, and said exactly what he meant by that, Hugh, that people who were in the factories, factories that were closing, the people who were languishing in prison long after their jail sentences should have been finished, the people who were looking to get into... the folks who were being strangled by our regulatory scheme that was hurting small businesses and property owners and taxpayers and public school parents. Chris, you were just -- okay. Listen. You were just able to speak two minutes uninterrupted, and I frankly think it was more punditry than reporting. So I would like to respond. If we were in court, your side would not even survive a motion to dismiss because you've got nothing. On this one, Don Jr.. Has very clearly said he was told that there would be some kind of information helpful to the campaign. It quickly became very apparent there was not. Let me say something about who goes into these meetings in the Trump campaign. We were a very small operation. I was not involved in June. I was involved in July. And became the campaign manager in August. It's very typical to have principals in the meeting. We had a fraction of the staff than Clinton had over there. You're trying to have your viewers think because these three principals were in there, it was viewed as some type of seriousness that simply is not true. This was standard operating procedure for the campaign. I felt like a woman who ran to be commander-in-chief and president of the United States, the first one ever, who talks about women's empowerment, took an awfully long time to give support to those women who were coming forward, and has still, as far as we know Bill, kept the money, kept the dirty money that dirty Harvey has given her in her campaign. Even her running mate yesterday, Tim Kaine, was asked about this, and you had people like her former campaign manager from her first failed campaign, not the second failed campaign, Patti Solis Doyle, coming forward and giving a very strong statement. As I recall, Ms. Doyle even said some people should go to jail over this. You have to go look at her statement. I'm really happy and heartened, and frankly, proud of many Democrats across the aisle and a lot of people in the mainstream media who are otherwise very anti-Trump, coming forward about this. The question remains, why in the world did Hillary Clinton lie to everyone and conceal such an important fact for two days saying she was overheated and dehydrated and then, of course, hours and hours later, after unfortunately, her health had become the biggest trending story of the day, not the 9/11 fallen, why wait all those hours? So I agree with you it's an important issue. And I think that there is one candidate in this race who has had recent health challenges that we all saw. I hope -- I agree with Donald Trump on this, and certainly I would hope all of us, regardless of your political persuasion, we're glad Hillary Clinton says she is feeling better and she will be back on the campaign trail soon, but the question remains that if this is about transparency and medical records and health conditions, then why was she so furtive in the business of concealment here? So what Donald Trump said in the meeting differed very little from what he said publicly including in his convention speech last month in Cleveland. We need a fair and humane way of dealing with what is estimated to be about 11 million illegal immigrants in this country. That was part of the discussion and it was robust. I have seen him animated in meetings like this where he is learning and taking notes and asking questions and receiving information. The rest of the conversation was about job creation and economic revitalization and the fact that small business growth among Hispanic and Latino Americans is on the rise. We talk about the inability to get access to capital and home ownership and religion and family being important. It was a very long and far reaching conversation. But nothing was said that differs from what Trump said previously. I have lots of friends who are in The Federalist Society. I'm a member of the board of visitors of The Federalist Society. And I'll tell you this. I think deep down most of those people know that Trump is wrong, and they know what right is, they just don't want to say it. It's just too painful. In fact at one point I learned from someone who had worked in the White House co"
Q719568," The Congressional Leadership Fund, a group with close ties to House GOP leadership, recently found that voters in battleground districts are more likely to think Republicans raised their taxes than cut them. And a recent Pew Research Center survey found that only around a third of adults thought the tax bill would help them and the country as a whole. `It's hard to envision a positive outcome in November if the middle class doesn't think we cut their taxes,' said Corry Bliss, the Leadership Fund's executive director. If anything, the fight over taxes is only about to escalate. Democratic lawmakers are holding `teach-ins' against the measure in their districts. As conservative groups prepare to spend tens of millions of dollars to sell the law, Democrats are preparing their own ad campaigns to portray it as helping only the rich. Around 4 in 5 taxpayers are expected to get a tax cut this year, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, and workers will start seeing bigger paychecks within weeks. But one other problem facing the GOP is that an average worker could get only about a $30 boost every two weeks, leading to questions about how much voters will notice. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me first thank the senator from Arizona and the senator from Delaware for expressing all of our concern about Russian interference in the 2016 election. It's absolutely clear they did, and the president has said as much on a number of occasions. Now, I agree in Helsinki he was less than clear about that, but he came back and said that he'd misspoke and reaffirmed his earlier position -- reaffirmed his earlier position that, yes, the Russia government had attempted to interfere in the election, although nobody disputes the fact that they were successful in changing a single vote or affecting the outcome. Ironically, the very same investigation which has made clear that the Russians did attempt to disrupt the election has also made clear there is no evidence of collusion that anybody has uncovered to date. So my concern is with -- with this resolution is that it is purely a symbolic act, and what we need to do is not just offer symbolic resolutions on the floor; we need to do the hard work that senators have to do through the regular order. Each of these nominees meet these exacting standards: they bring to the bench decades of public service and private sector experience in civil and criminal law, in the courtroom and in our appellate courts. And together they represent the richness and diversity that makes Texas so proud. I want to congratulate each one of you for getting this far in the process. As I said, it's not an easy one. I'm sure you would agree. And I again want to thank Chairman Grassley for scheduling the hearing. I know it's rare to hold a nominations hearing this late in a presidential election year. I want to extend a welcome to all of your families who are with you and to congratulate them because I know this is not an honor for you alone. It is for your families and the people who helped you get to this point, Law enforcement officers selflessly put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities, and in return they deserve our unparalleled support for the irreplaceable role they serve. The Back the Blue Act sends a clear message that our criminal justice system simply will not tolerate those who viciously and deliberately target our law enforcement. While it should not take an event like this to jolt our consciences, we've got to consider more ways to support our public servants who are tasked with the daunting responsibility of keeping order, enforcing the rule of law, and protecting our communities. Whether it's DARPA or Army Futures Command looking to invest in these startup companies that have potential dual-use applications, once they get it up and running, they go about their business and then the business looks to get commercial investment. China and other potential adversaries of the United States are more than happy to try and get access to technology we, ourselves, have been responsible for creating. We have to be aware of the fact that China has been aggressive in this space. That's why it was important to update the rules by which the committee on foreign investment operates. Having adopted the state of Texas as his home as a young adult, we Texans were privileged to have him as one of our own. President Bush once said, `I am a Texan and an American... What more could a man ask?' I don't think anyone could have said it better. His uncompromising service to Texas and this nation can never be duplicated or fully quantified, but his impact is unmistakable and his legacy everlasting. I know all Texans and Americans across the country join Sandy and me in mourning a courageous American leader as we send our deepest condolences to the entire Bush family. On this day in 1836, a band of settlers from across Texas took charge of their own destiny and declared "
Q221997," Knowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence, and not having security be the first priority when -- when we invaded, it was a mistake. I wouldn't have gone in, however, for the people that did lose their lives, and the families that suffer because of it -- I know this full well because as governor of the state of Florida, I called every one of them. Every one of them that I could find to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them, and it was really hard to do. And, every one of them said that their child did not die in vain, or their wife, of their husband did not die in vain. So, why it was difficult for me to do it was based on that. Here's the lesson that we should take from this, which relates to this whole subject, Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq. He left, and when he left Al Qaida was done for. ISIS was created because of the void that we left, and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana. To honor the people that died, we need to -- we need to -- stop the -- Iran agreement, for sure, because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands, and we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal. When President Obama says that `for too long we've been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present,' he is speaking the truth. But we should be just as candid about our failures in addressing injustices of the more recent origin. In our cities we've got so many people that have never known anything but poverty is. So many young adults with no vision of a life beyond the life they know. It's a tragedy for them in such a loss to our country because everyone has a God-given purpose to live out and God-given talents this world needs. Every one of them was also promised one-day break in life in the form of a public school to help them learn who they are and what they can do. For millions it is a false promise as technology advances, the first rung of the latter is higher and higher and higher. If we don't create an education system that allows young people to reach it, we are setting them up for a lifetime of failure. You and I have to call the situation what it is. The worst inequality in America today and the source of so many other inequalities. I want to work with the Urban League movement to end this injustice once and for all. I have repeatedly said is a terrible deal. Congress should reject it and it would be best to do so before Iran is given more than $100 billion in sanctions relief that they can use to further destabilize the region. Should it be upheld, as President I would begin immediately to responsibly get us out of this deal, with a comprehensive strategy that is responsive to the conditions at the time and confronts Iran's continued pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability, its support for terrorism and instability, its ballistic missile proliferation, and its horrific human rights record. Such a strategy will require a new national security team that is committed to rebuilding our defenses and restoring our alliances, starting with our relationship with Israel. It will require sustained diplomatic efforts to put significant financial, diplomatic, and military pressure on Iran to change its behavior. And because of the massive sanctions relief provided by this terrible deal, the impact of unilateral U.S. sanctions will be limited and it will be important to work with our allies to reimpose multilateral sanctions and pressure. We need to clearly confront the ambitions Iran has in the region. We need to reinstate sanctions to do what's necessary to make sure that they don't get fresh capital from Europe and other countries, companies that want to try to profit. they're going to have to make a choice. Are they going to want to do business in the largest economy, with the greatest respect for the rule of law, or are they going to trade that in for a [ n ] Iranian economy that's controlled by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard that -- where there is no rule of law? I think we need to re-engage with our allies to create a serious confrontation with Iran. The irony of all this is that the greatest ally of Israel has helped, aided, and abetted to create the greatest existential threat of that country since its beginning. And we need to make sure that we also support Israel. It would create a deterrent effect if we provided Israel with the necessary sophisticated arms, so that they know -- that the Iranians know, that we're serious about confronting their ambitions across the board, both nuclear and otherwise. I'd say it [ the number one threat facing the U.S. ] is Islamic terrorism, and, back to the question of what we are dealing with in Iraq, when we pull back voids are filled. That's the lesson of history, and, sadly, this president does not believe in American leadership. He does not believe it, and the net result is that we have a caliphate the size of Indiana that gains energy each and every day to recruit Ameri"
Q28229066," If an American consumer goes to Canada and walks into a brick-and-mortar Canadian pharmacy and buys a medicine, they're getting a high-quality drug because of Canada's first-class drug regulatory process. When a consumer goes online to buy medicines purportedly from Canada, they may get a medicine sourced from elsewhere that could be counterfeit, expired or misbranded. While operations or illegal online pharmacies may state on their websites that its medicines are coming from Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, etc., this is not necessarily always the case. Such operations and illegal online pharmacies take advantage of unsuspecting Americans by purporting to distribute safe and effective imported drugs, at least some of which are instead expired, mislabeled, subject to recalls or potentially counterfeit and that are provided outside of the closed American distribution system meant to protect patient safety. Such schemes are particularly egregious, as they deceive patients and their employers who provide prescription drug coverage. Operations like CanaRx use their names to imply that patients are receiving medicines approved in Canada, when it's likely that patients are receiving medicines from other countries, and which may be sub-potent, super-potent or counterfeit. Importantly, they're also distributing drugs for which the FDA-approved versions are subject to additional safety requirements, such as special handling or specific safety requirements that apply when drugs are administered to patients (called REMS programs) because the risks associated with the medicines are serious and need to be carefully managed in order to protect patients. These risk mitigation programs are a legal requirement and are in place for important safety reasons. Sidestepping them is unacceptable and puts the safety of patients in great jeopardy. We're also troubled by robust marketing tactics, like those of CanaRx, which are used to give false credence to their operation. To protect patients from these unapproved drugs, we urge employers and any enrolled employees not to use any medicines from CanaRx. The FDA will pursue additional enforcement actions as needed. We recognize that tracking and tracing products is critical to industry's ability to detect and remove potentially dangerous drugs from the drug supply chain. This pilot is one of many steps we're taking to foster innovative ways to improve the security of the drug supply. We're also focused on making improvements across the other products we regulate, especially related to food and our ability to address foodborne outbreaks. We're invested in exploring new ways to improve traceability, in some cases using the same technologies that can enhance drug supply chain security, like the use of blockchain. To advance these efforts, the FDA recently recruited Frank Yiannas, an expert on the use of traceability technologies in global food supply chains. He'll be working closely with me on ways for the FDA to facilitate the expansion of such methods, such as blockchain technology, to further strengthen the U.S. food supply. Under his leadership, we'll continue to leverage all tools available to ensure greater accountability. For the drug track-and-trace system, our goals are to fully secure electronic product tracing, which provides a step-by-step account of where a drug product has been located and who has handled it; establish a more robust product verification to ensure that a drug product is legitimate and unaltered; and to make sure that any party involved in handling drugs in the supply chain must have the ability to spot and quarantine and investigate any suspect drug. We're committed to staying at the forefront of new and emerging technologies and how they might be used to create safer, smarter and more trusted supply chains to better protect consumer safety and ensure the integrity of the high quality of products they deserve. For example, certain drugs may be absorbed by the body faster when taken with a high-fat meal; and faster absorption may cause an excessive response or other health issues. In other cases, food may not have a clinically meaningful impact on the drug whatsoever. Today we're releasing new recommendations for companies on how to conduct food effect studies early in drug development, to promptly uncover potential issues. These recommendations can help identify absorption challenges earlier in the development process and result in safer and more effective medicines and better information for patients. It can also help make drug development more efficient. If, for example, a company determines there's no food effect on absorption, they may be able to conduct pivotal trials without regard to food. Another type of study important to early drug development, bioavailability or BA studies, examines the rate and amount of an active ingredient absorbed by the body as one measure of the product's overall effect. These studies provide crucial information on "
Q24248265," The trust fund that pays Medicare's hospital expenses will run out of money in 2029,... according to a federal report. The Social Security program will remain solvent until 2034. Together, Medicare and Social Security comprised 42 percent of federal program spending in 2016. Medicare covered 56.8 million beneficiaries in 2016 and Social Security provided benefits for 60.9 million people. The trustees include representatives of the Treasury Department, Health and Human Services, Labor and Social Security. They noted that the growth in national health spending in the U.S. has slowed in recent years. But they said it was unclear how much of that reflected the temporary effects of the economic downturn, as opposed to systemic changes in how health care is being used and paid for that could result in savings in years to come. The slowdown in growth helped keep the Medicare program solvent for an additional year longer than the last projection. `The trajectory is still alarming. That is why the trustees issue the warning that we do -- the same warning that has been issued for years now -- that Congress must act to ensure the long-term fiscal viability, sustainability and survival of Medicare and Social Security,' said Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price. `A combination of an aging population and tepid economic growth has produced the projected short-falls for both Social Security and Medicare... persistent and strong economic growth can help bring these programs to sustainable solvency, cautiously optimistic.

Q529294," The uptick in awards paid out under the mandatory award program is good news. Whistleblowers have long been frustrated with the lack of awards, which may be part of the reason claims were down 17 percent from previous years. I hope the increase in awards will reverse this trend and send a signal of things to come. I also was glad to see positive statements about the program by the new director of the whistleblower office, as well as his effort to release this report in a much more timely manner than in previous years. The information about the whistleblower program is helpful for the public and for Congress in knowing how the whistleblower office is performing. I appreciate that the report adopted GAO recommendations that will make it easier for Congress and others to evaluate the program from year to year. But I'm concerned that it looks as if the IRS has dropped some of the more detailed information it provided before about how long it takes claims to move through each step of the process. That's an important data point. Whistleblowers often put their livelihoods on the line to point out tax fraud, and they need assurances that the IRS will move their cases along as quickly as possible. Furthermore, when a veteran receives a letter stating that the VA believes he is unable to manage his finances, that veteran now has the burden of proving that he is in fact competent to manage his benefit payments and does not need a fiduciary. However, underlying the hearing is a real possibility that the right to firearms will be infringed. Therefore, in light of the liberty and property interests involved, placing the burden of proof on the veteran is highly suspect. Under similar circumstances, the burden is generally on the government. Further, the hearing that takes place is inside the VA administrative system and composed of VA employees rather than a neutral decision maker. Under the current practice, a VA finding that concludes that a veteran requires a fiduciary to administer benefit payments effectively voids his Second Amendment rights-a consequence which is wholly unrelated to and unsupported by the record developed in the VA process. Accordingly, Congress needs to understand what justifies taking such action without more due process protections for the veteran. That is disappointing, particularly the lack of increase for biodiesel levels and the cut in cellulosic level requirements. Increases in the volume requirements are justified and would be good public policy. Congress intended for the RFS to drive growth in biofuels across all categories. Contrary to that goal, this final rule does little to encourage investment and growth in advanced biofuels. While I hoped for higher levels, they aren't unexpected and are unfortunately in line with EPA's original proposal. I'm glad that EPA backed off a later proposal, which would have represented an abandonment of President Trump's stated commitment to biofuels and the integrity of the RFS. Iowa, rural America and the entire country are made stronger by the many jobs, increased energy independence and cleaner air that biofuels provide. The grassroots energy of this growing industry will continue to be a good news story for the nation. I plan to continue working to impress upon the Administration the capability to grow domestic energy production by unlocking the full potential of biofuels. I've heard from many Iowans about how Obamacare has failed them. I'll continue to work with my fellow senators on repairing the damage done by Obamacare. I'll look at what options for votes come before the Senate and decide what makes the most sense for Iowans. I'd like to have the chance to vote for a motion to proceed so 100 senators would have the opportunity to debate health care. If that succeeds, I'd decide how to vote on the bill we take up, depending on which bill it is and whether we're able to amend it. I hope the state of Iowa gets an answer soon on the waiver proposal that would help people in dire straits this fall. If nothing is done, the 72,000 Iowans on Obamacare will face hardship keeping their insurance this fall. The state's proposal would help, and it should go forward. Beyond that, the Senate should continue looking for ways to make health insurance more affordable and accessible. Insurance doesn't do much good if you can't afford to use it, and that's the situation too many Iowans and other Americans are in right now because of Obamacare. Despite their quest to score political points, they are grounding out with basic misinformation. They claim that a lower refund from the IRS proves that taxpayers are paying more in taxes. This argument fails to acknowledge what a tax refund means. Taxpayers who receive a tax refund have overpaid what they owe the IRS in the first place. Getting a refund means taxpayers take home less pay from each paycheck throughout the year. Instead, more of their hard-earned money is deposited directly into Uncle Sam's piggy bank. Now, c"

When you consider the lack of success they've had in picking the two actual teams to meet for the title in the last twenty years, it could be the proverbial I think he's one of the most outstanding nominees we could have for this position. I did not know him well when the process began. I knew he had done a very good job as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. But I have to tell you, through the process of him going through the confirmation hearings and the conversations we've had, the meetings we've had, I think he's going to be exemplary... For the last 15 months, he served our nation as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and I think everyone knows how he's run that department or that agency. I think everyone knows the culture that he has built there. The State Department right now has terrible culture. The morale is terrible. A lot of positions, as my friend the ranking member mentioned, have not been filled. But they also feel like that they haven't had a leader in some time that has really stood behind them and raised them up to leverage our diplomatic efforts around the world. I believe this particular nominee will be excellently suited for that. He's demonstrated that at the C.I.A. I strongly support his nomination. And with that, I hope we will vote. I look forward to him serving our nation I don't know of a person in the United States of America that could have more current knowledge about what is happening around the world in his current role. As we know, he already met with the North Koreans. We have known for some time that the C.I.A. has been our contact, our backchannel, with the North Koreans. He's the perfect person to come in at this time and lead those efforts diplomatically. We as a body have a responsibility at this time to reclaim our responsibilities as it relates to tariffs and revenues. Allow the president to continue to negotiate, allow him to do so, but when he completes his work, he should bring whatever it is he would like to impose on other countries, especially since he's using Section 232 in ways that it was never intended, he should bring that to the United States Senate and to the United States House of Representatives, and we should decide what tariffs should be put in place. I plan to come back and speak on this matter tomorrow. I hope that at some point as pressure builds, as chaos is created in other countries and around the world, as our leadership role in the world continues to take a hit and be challenged, I hope the United States Senate will rise to the occasion. I want to thank those many people on both sides of the aisle that have sponsored legislation to deal with this. I hope the leader of the Senate and the minority leader of the Senate will decide that this is an important issue that we need to take up and that we will take action, This is a purposely contrived fight over, at the end of the day no matter who wins, our borders are still going to be insecure.

I'm a junior senator from Tennessee, and 69 people voted for $46 billion to secure our border. It was overly prescriptive, and it was overkill, but our borders would have been secure.

Q1235731," It came as no surprise to anybody -- I haven't done this since I was chief of staff, the last time I was up here was for the budget briefings, right? Something you all asked me was, `what are you doing with the foreign aid, since we absolutely gutted it, right' ? President Trump isn't a big fan of foreign aid: never has been, still isn't. He doesn't like spending money overseas, especially when it's poorly spent. And that is exactly what drove this decision. I've been in the office with him talking with him a couple of times and he says, `Mick, this is a corrupt place, everybody knows this is a corrupt place.' And put this in context: this is what happened in Puerto Rico when we got a lot heat because we didn't want to give aid to Puerto Rico because we thought they were corrupt. By the way, it turned out he was right, so put that as your context. So he said, `look, I don't want to send money to a corrupt place, have them waste it, have them spend it so they can line their own pockets, plus, I'm not sure that other European countries are helping them out either' . So we actually looked at that during that time -- when we cut the money off, before the money actually flowed because the money flowed by the end of the fiscal year, we actually did an analysis of what other countries were doing in terms of supporting Ukraine. What I found out was that zero or near zero dollars for Ukraine in lethal aid: we give them tanks, and they give them pillows. As vocal as the Europeans are about supporting Ukraine, they are really, really stingy when it comes to lethal aid, and they weren't helping Ukraine, to this day they still are now, and the president did not like that. I know this is a long answer to your question but I'm still going. Those were the driving factors. Did he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that's it, and that's why we held up the money.

No question about that. But that's it, and that's why we held up the money. I have seen the same data and heard the same things that the general mentioned. It does make one wonder what the Obama Administration did with all the money that we spent on defense over the course of the last eight years, but I will tell you this Maria, in arriving at the $54 billion, there's a couple of different things that got us to that number. First, it was the number that the President promised during the campaign. It's the number that would be for the military, $603 billion if there were no military sequester. That was very specific. The President set out to undo the military sequester, that's exactly what this does. We sat down with the Defense Department, with the Pentagon, to go over how much money they actually needed to start solving some of these problems. We are not going to undo the damage that has been done in just one year. This is the first step of several years of additional defense spending this President wants to see, but, again, we worked in close lock step with the DOD to arrive at this number.... I'm just saying we managed to do so, and I don't want to min"

Q22279," The first was his mocking of a reporter with disabilities, a shocking display that did not receive the scrutiny it deserved. I kept expecting Mr. Trump to apologize, at least privately, but he did not, instead denying that he had done what seemed undeniable to anyone who watched the video. At the time, I hoped that this was a terrible lapse, not a pattern of abuse. The second was Mr. Trump's repeated insistence that Gonzalo Curiel, a federal judge born and raised in Indiana, could not rule fairly in a case involving Trump University because of his Mexican heritage. For Mr. Trump to insist that Judge Curiel would be biased because of his ethnicity demonstrated a profound lack of respect not only for the judge but also for our constitutional separation of powers, the very foundation of our form of government. Again, I waited in vain for Mr. Trump to retract his words. Third was Donald Trump's criticism of the grieving parents of Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq. It is inconceivable that anyone, much less a presidential candidate, would attack two Gold Star parents. Rather than honoring their sacrifice and recognizing their pain, Mr. Trump disparaged the religion of the family of an American hero. And once again, he proved incapable of apologizing, of saying he was wrong. While I recognize that the president has the legal authority to designate national monuments, I believe he should not have used his executive authority given the objection lodged by the Maine Legislature, the lack of consensus among Mainers who live in the area, and the absence of congressional approval. Bypassing Congress and taking this action without the support of the state and the local communities circumvented discussions of alternatives such as the creation of a national recreation area or management by the Forest Service -- proposals that might have had broader support than the president unilaterally designating a national monument. This monument designation gives rise to a host of questions ranging from simple logistical matters to fundamental questions such as what will the impact be on taxpayers and whether the National Park Service, with its nearly $12 billion maintenance backlog, can afford to manage this new federal acquisition. While the Quimby family's promise of a $40 million endowment is generous, it is difficult to see how that amount can possibly cover the startup and ongoing costs of the monument area. When the primary season started, it soon became apparent that, much like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Mr. Trump was connecting with many Americans who felt that their voices were not being heard in Washington and who were tired of political correctness. But rejecting the conventions of political correctness is different from showing complete disregard for common decency. Mr. Trump did not stop with shedding the stilted campaign dialogue that often frustrates voters. Instead, he opted for a constant stream of denigrating comments, including demeaning Sen. John McCain's (R-Ariz.) heroic military service and repeatedly insulting Fox News host Megyn Kelly. With the passage of time, I have become increasingly dismayed by his constant stream of cruel comments and his inability to admit error or apologize. But it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing -- either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level -- that revealed Mr. Trump as unworthy of being our president. The new Democratic majority that takes command of the House on Thursday starts with 21 fewer seats than the party held the last time it elected Nancy Pelosi as speaker. But this new majority may prove easier for the party to both manage legislatively and defend electorally. Though slightly smaller, the Democratic caucus that's assuming power is far more ideologically and geographically cohesive than the party's previous majority 10 years ago. While the 2009 class included a large number of Democrats from blue-collar, culturally conservative, rural seats that were politically trending away from the party, the new majority revolves around white-collar and racially diverse urban and suburban districts that are trending toward it. That won't eliminate all internal disagreements inside the caucus... But it does mean that as Pelosi returns to the speakership after the party's eight-year exile in the minority, she is unlikely to face anything comparable to the systematic resistance she confronted before... Earlier this week I voted against proceeding to health care reform legislation -- the American Health Care Act of 2017 -- that passed the House of Representatives last May without a single Democratic vote. For many Americans, this bill could actually make the situation worse. Among other things, the bill would make sweeping changes to the Medicaid program -- an important safety net that for more than 50 years has helped poor and disabl"
Q3956796," But we've got to deliver on it. That means making sure that we get corporate rates down, making sure that we double the standard deduction for moms and dads and aunts and uncles on Main Street, making sure that we deliver. For that, I think it's also critical in the next two weeks -- either this week or the following week -- we make some real critical decisions on tax reform so we start working the legislative language. That means the Border Adjustment Tax (BAT) is dead -- you can argue for it or against it -- but the reality is there's not enough senators and not enough members of Congress to support it so we must go ahead and move on. For me, I'm really closer to the president's plan on tax reform. We need to make sure we have a corporate rate that's 15 to 16 percent. We also need to make sure it passes through to those small businesses. And we need to do a repatriation plan that allows us to bring back those foreign earnings and allows us to put them back to work creating American jobs again. We can't delay. One of the things is we continue to get surprised by deadlines we know are coming. It's kind of like the debt ceiling. We need to go ahead and address it. It's kind of like a florist being surprised by Valentine's Day. It's coming, we might as well go ahead and make the decision. I think it's time, and I think the next two weeks are critical. Hopefully, the voice of the American people will stand up against it. But it is a critical time. Indeed, the president is not understating how critical this week is. But we also have the opportunity to do it right or do it wrong. And, I'm afraid that as what happens when Capitol Hill normally gets involved in things, the tendency is to do it wrong. As you mentioned, we're going to vote on Wednesday morning for Hurricane Harvey relief. Many conservatives believe that if we keep that as just a clean relief effort, no pork, no leverage, no debt ceiling added to it, that it will fly through not only the House but the Senate. But what we do anticipate is that the Senate will add, as you mentioned, the $2 trillion debt increase and send it back to the House. I think that not only does that send a very bad message, it just says that the people that have suffered so much in Texas now are being used as a leverage to just promote an increase in the federal credit card. It's just not the right way to do it. We're going to push back as conservatives. We're starting to build momentum. Indeed, the president is not understating how critical this week is.

President Obama's plan to close Guantanamo Bay is woefully misguided and poses a grave security threat to both the homeland as well as our armed forces serving abroad. We've already seen cases in which Gitmo detainees return to terrorism upon release. Most notably, Ibrahim Qosi, also known as Sheikh Khubayb al Sudani, is now an al Qaeda leader in Yemen. Releasing Guantanamo terrorists abroad amounts to granting amnesty to terrorists. Further, transferring Gitmo prisoners to U.S. facilities violates the National Defense Authorization Act of 2015, which specifically barred relocating Gitmo prisoners to U.S. soil. The majority of Americans continue to oppose closing Guantanamo Bay because they understand the security threat posed by housing convicted terrorists on American soil. I strongly urge the President to rethink this flawed and dangerous plan. Our national security is more important than the President's attempts to make good on 2008 campaign promises. I am honored to have had the privilege to serve the people of Western North Carolina and hope to have earned your continued support. Since being elected to Congress in 2012, my focus has been making my constituents' voices heard in Washington. At the end of the day, my voting card may have my picture on it, but it belongs to the people of North Carolina. Our nation is truly at a crossroads. We face imminent threats from terrorists abroad and crippling debt back home. Yet I am optimistic. I believe that our country's best days are ahead. In my time in Washington, I've wo"
Q212648," You're asking the wrong person because I had five uncles who were police officers, two cousins who were, one who died in the line of duty. I ran the largest and best police department in the world, the New York City Police Department. And I saved more black lives than any of those people you saw on stage by reducing crime and particularly homicide by 75 percent. Of which, maybe 4,000 or 5,000 were African-American young people who are alive today because of the policies I put in effect that weren't in effect for 35 years. So if you're going to do that, then you also should symbolize why the police officers are in the neighborhoods and what are you going to go about that? To me it's two easy answers: a much better education and good job, and what the heck have you done like in Baltimore, when they all stood in Baltimore. I was sick when I saw all the politicians sitting, standing in Baltimore after the police situation and saying, `nobody's done anything for this community in 50 years.' Well, that is a heck of a thing to say, because they've been in charge for 50 years. And they have failed the community. I didn't fail Harlem. I turned Harlem around. I didn't fail Bedford-Stuyvesant, I turned it around. Go there now. Go walk in Harlem. Then flash back to 25 years ago and go to Harlem before I was mayor, and one was a place where crime was rampant and no national stores and now there's a thriving community in Harlem. you've spearheaded several campaigns around the world the media call `apology tours.' You make no secret of your belief that America's history calls for some sort of apology. Tell us, Mr. President: Can you name a country that ever amassed more power and yet abused it less than the United States of America? Can you name another country that ever amassed more wealth and distributed it more fairly than the United States of America? Can you name another country that was attacked by the world's two superpowers, Germany and Japan, defeated them both, and then, after total victory, wound up with less territory than before the war? Can you name another country that had a problem as egregious as America's race problem, and solved it without foreign troops with bayonets? And finally, Mr. President, can you name another country that had the nuclear bomb exclusively for four years and tucked it away, using it neither as threat nor blackmail, while rebuilding the devastated homelands of our allies and enemies with American treasure, after having recaptured those lands with American blood? There are things you can do. First of all, the president can advocate strongly for vouchers for choice and for charter schools. And go up against and fight the battle against the National Education Association and all the education bureaucrats. It's a tragedy that -- I hate to get personal, but it was true of me, too. My children went to private school, and President Obama's children go to private school. Children that don't have parents that have the means to do that can't. Well, I always felt guilty about that. And I always felt that meant I should be in favor of vouchers. And he should be in favor of vouchers if he really cares about the African-American community because the public school system has let them down and vouchers, which would allow you to choose the school that your child would go to -- and charter schools would create the kind of competition that we need to fix our school system. We need a revolution in our public school system if we're going to save the next generation of young people. No police officer should act in a way in which he has done that should be punished severely. I personally have prosecuted 70 police officers and put them in prison when I was U.S. Attorney and was instrumental in police officers being prosecuted by Loretta Lynch when I was mayor. On the other hand, I also recognize that 75 percent of the murder victims in New York City are black. The police have to be present in the black community. Not necessarily because they want to be, not because you'd like to have them there, but because that's where the murders are taking place. From the time I became mayor and the time I left, murder went down from 1900 to 500. Then Mayor Bloomberg brought it down to 300. It's now going up again. In that period of time, we saved thousands and thousands of mostly black lives by putting white police officers in areas where they were at risk. Now the New York City Police Department is a non-majority white police department. There was a great fear that the new president would be surrounded by, literally, enemies of the president who were involved in that and people who are involved with other Democratic operatives, and one particular oligarch who would influence him, and I'm convinced from what I've heard from two very reliable people tonight that the president is surrounded by people who are enemies of the president, and people who are -- at least one case -- clearly corrupt and involved in this schem"
Q1174175," We did the recording in Sparta, IL. at Gary Gordon's Inside -- Out Studios starting in July 2015, working as our road schedule and Gary's schedule allowed and by August 2016 we had finished. Gary finished mixing by December and I asked Gary to send the master to Ken at Rounder. I called Ken and told him that we had recorded that Charlie Poole project that we were talking about two years earlier and it needed a home. Luckily, he, Marion Leighton-Levy and Bill Nowlin did love the record and agreed to promote the project. I hadn't even mentioned to Ken that we were going to do the album, he didn't know anything about it until Gary sent him the master. Later on, I was happy to hear how foundational Charlie Poole and his music was to the three original Rounders. This fact made their accepting our treatment of the material even more pleasing to us. Also, the ultra-care that they, as well as the Rounder Nashville family, have given to every aspect of the album's production has been wonderful! Muddying the waters is wrong and will leave a toxic legacy. Under the Westminster system Her Majesty's Government controls the Parliamentary agenda. Backbenchers should not arbitrarily be able to take away that power. How does this affect the national interest at a time when the Government is negotiating with the EU? Where does power lie? Who controls the legislative agenda? Who is accountable and how? These are all fundamental questions for our democracy, not playthings for anti-Brexit MPs to tinker with. Some of the present machinations bring our unwritten constitution and Parliamentary system into disrepute. They threaten the viability and integrity of the House of Commons as whole. This must stop, and it must stop now. Firstly, remember the reason we're not releasing them -- there was a House of Commons vote in December of last year where we said that we are not required to release anything which undermines the negotiation or the national interest frankly, or the negotiating stance of the British government. That is the reasoning behind it. But I don't think you should overestimate what's in them. They're not economic models of each sector, they are looking at how much of it depends on European Union versus other markets, what other opportunities may be, what the regulatory structures are, all those sorts of things that inform the negotiation, but they are not predictions. So I wouldn't overestimate what they are. ... The presumption in all this is that we have a magical, frictionless system at the moment. Actually, we will have seen on our television screens that that is not true. This entire House will have watched Operation Stack in progress over various years. Operation Stack is what we do when one of the ports gets locked up for one reason or another -- a strike in France or whatever. It has been operated 74 times in 20 years. In 2015, it took up 31 days of friction, and our businesses -- the just-in-time businesses and the perishable goods businesses -- all coped with it, so let us not frighten ourselves in doing this negotiation. Nobody wants it and nobody likes it, but they cope with it. I would expect the new Prime Minister on September 9th to immediately trigger a large round of global trade deals with all our most favoured trade partners. I would expect that the negotiation phase of most of them to be concluded within between 12 and 24 months. So within two years, before the negotiation with the EU is likely to be complete, and therefore before anything material has changed, we can negotiate a free trade area massively larger than the EU. Trade deals with the US and China alone will give us a trade area almost twice the size of the EU, and of course we will also be seeking deals with Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, India, Japan, the UAE, Indonesia -- and many others. We will need a leader with focus and drive, a combination of conviction and tenacity. There is no shortage of talent in our party, but the demands on him or her will be great. Bluntly Brexit alone will require a unique combination of intellect, determination, decisiveness and courage. The next stage of Brexit, and the coming election will both be a real test of the character of the next prime minister. With all these considerations the standout candidate is Dominic Raab, so I will back him if he runs. I have known and worked with Dominic over the last 13 years so I know he has the vision and personal attributes required to lead us at these crossroads in our history. Things actually are getting better and we need to talk it up, and mention it all the time. Not be sucked into the managerial elements of government. We've got wonderful liberal values as long as we hang by them. We've got 60 million people, and we have more power, influence and reach, and a better reputation than we have any right to expect. We are leading members of the G20, Nato, the leading member of the Commonwealth. English is the language of science, the internet, of Hollywood, of "
Q720121," Well, there could be. But that is really addressing the problem that you see now. If we're going to house them in Arkansas, we would want to do it in a compassionate way. You're still going to have a separation from the children unless you took all of the families to one of the installations and said this is where they're going to be housed both individually or as a family unit. So that's a challenge. It's not easy housing them as family units because if you're going to do it as family units, are you going to put multiple families in there together? Are you going to keep them separate housing units? That's pretty doggone expensive. So this is a huge challenge to us and what the Democrats are advocating is just go back the way we've always done things before, which is to let them flood across the border and not have any consequence and not have any way to discourage continued danger to those children coming across the border. Parents need to make better decisions and say we're not going to put our children at risk by coming across that border. I know that's what President Trump is trying to accomplish, but we're going to have to have a better solution at the border, so we don't see and we don't have this adverse impact, traumatic experience for the children. Every generation must affirm and live American values anew. Equal opportunity and respect for all races is fundamental to what is great about our country. The whole concept of white supremacy or neo-nazi dogma must be rejected at every turn. After the Charlottesville violence I consistently spoke out against the racism and hatred and violence displayed before a national audience. When it comes to the debate about our historical monuments, we cannot change history but we must learn from it. We should not start taking down monuments just because they remind us of an unpleasant past. Refusing to face our history by dismantling it is a mistake. We should use our historical markers as teaching opportunities to provide greater leadership for the future. Part of the legislation I signed to separate the holidays of Dr. Martin Luther King and Robert E. Lee was to use the history of the Civil War as a teaching opportunity for our students. In regard to the comments of President Trump, I am grateful that he clearly denounced white supremacy in very clear terms. But this is a moment that we need our leaders to take every opportunity to educate this generation about the pure evil of nazism and to bring our country together. The ABC serves an important role for the state, and I am glad she has agreed to help out and lead the organization as Interim Director. Casteel, 38, joined ABC in 2013. The ABC regulates the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages in Arkansas, and currently oversees more than 5,000 permit holders in the state. Lueken, 73, said it was simply time for him to retire after 28 years, but he told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette what I'd been told by another ABC source: that the governor had asked for Roberts' resignation. The governor's press aide repeatedly denied this. I'd also asked Casteel yesterday if she'd return to the agency if asked and she indicated she wasn't sure, though she insisted she'd been thinking about a move to private practice for a long time. She said she'd had no problems with Roberts' leadership, a potential factor cited by another source. Casteel has been a pivotal worker in developing regulations the agency will use in overseeing the new medical marijuana law. Her resignation had been set to take effect June 16. Casteel made about $73,000 as staff attorney and Roberts made about $89,000 as agency director. I've asked what her interim pay will be. UPDATE: She Earlier today Senator Linda Chesterfield, Senator Joyce Elliott, Representative Charles Blake and I met to discuss a number of concerns that Senator Chesterfield raised regarding the Little Rock School District. Senator Chesterfield requested this meeting and given her background as a former educator, I especially welcomed her thoughts on the matter. Additionally, she requested that a number of Little Rock School District parents join us for our meeting. Today I listened as they discussed the potential closure of Carver, Franklin and other elementary schools, and I value the ideas and perspective each one was able to offer. I have advised these parents and state legislators that the success of the LRSD is very important to me and the entire State of Arkansas. I have the utmost confidence in the leadership of both Commissioner Johnny Key and LRSD Superintendent Mike Poore with regard to the education of students in Arkansas and the LRSD. Furthermore, I'm delighted that Superintendent Poore has sought feedback from parents of those impacted schools, and I look forward to his report when it is completed in January. Currently ADEQ is charged with issuing permits and conducting oversight of [ such ] disposal systems. ADEQ's process is effective and fair. It balances the needs"
Q6182718," Thank you, Mr. President, for the faith you have shown in me through this nomination. I am both honored and humbled by this opportunity to serve our great country. If I am confirmed by the Senate, I will do everything within my power to achieve the goals assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress: stable prices and maximum employment. I want to thank my wife, Elissa, for her love, support, and wise counsel. Without her, I would not be standing here. We are thinking today of our three children, and of the world they are inheriting. My five siblings and I are also thinking today of our parents, who gave us so many gifts, most of all a loving home. In the years since the global financial crisis ended, our economy has made substantial progress toward full recovery. By many measures we are close to full employment, and inflation has gradually moved up toward our target. Our financial system is without doubt far stronger and more resilient than it was before the crisis. Our banks have much higher capital and liquidity, are more aware of the risks they run, and are better able to manage those risks. While post-crisis improvements in regulation and supervision have helped us to achieve these gains, I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that the Federal Reserve remains vigilant and prepared to respond to changes in markets and evolving risks. Finally, I have had the great privilege of serving under Chairman Bernanke and Chair Yellen, who guided the economy with insight and courage through difficult times while moving monetary policy toward greater transparency and predictability. Each of them embodies the highest ideals of public service -- unquestioned integrity and unflinching commitment to fulfilling our mandate. Inside the Federal Reserve, we understand that monetary policy decisions matter for American families and communities. I strongly share that sense of mission and am committed to making decisions with objectivity and based on the best available evidence, in the longstanding tradition of monetary policy independence. Mr. President, thank you again for this extraordinary opportunity to serve the American people. Weâ € ™ re never going to consider any political considerations whatsoever. â €  Many analysts had expected that other central banks might act in concert with the Fed this week, cutting their own rates and presenting investors and businesses with a united front that might have delivered an extra boost of confidence. Instead, the Fed is acting mostly on its own, for now. On Tuesday, Australiaâ € ™ s central bank said it was cutting its official rate to a record low of 0.5%. But several leading central banks, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and Swiss National Bank, already have lowered their borrowing rates into negative territory. The ECB and BoJ are also buying bonds and other financial assets to try to jump-start their economies. They face greater opposition to further cuts. â € œThe Fed judged that it could not wait until the ECB in particular was ready to move, â €  Krishna Guha and Ernie Tedeschi, analysts at Evercore ISI, said in a research note. The last time the Fed took action between its policy meetings, it co-ordinated with five other central banks. In November 2011, the six central banks agreed to make it cheaper for overseas banks to borrow in dollars. Powell tried to strike a balanced tone at his news conference, by making it clear that the Fed was aware of the threat and stood ready to bolster the economy, while also emphasizing that U.S. economic fundamentals are sound. â € œThe virus and the measures that are being taken to contain it will surely weigh on economic activity both here and abroad for some time, â €  he said. â € œSo, we saw a risk to the economy, and we chose to act. So, we monitor financial stability risks very carefully all of the time. It's what we do since the financial crisis... Currently, we don't see large imbalances. This long expansion is notable for the lack of large financial imbalances like the ones we've seen certainly before the crisis happened. So, we have a four-part framework, I'll quickly mention. The first is leverage in the financial system which is low by historical standards. The second is funding risk which is the risk of runnable funding, and that risk is also quite low for banks but also for the nonbanking financial sector. If you look at asset prices, we see some high asset prices, but not broadly across a range. We don't see bubbles in that kind of thing. And, that leaves the fourth which is leverage in the nonfinancial sector and that's households and businesses. So, with households, again, we don't see leverage. We see them actually getting in very good shape financially in the aggregate. Obviously, plenty of households are not in great shape financially, but in the aggregate, the household sector's in a very good place. That leaves businesses which is where the issue has been. Leverage among c"
Q3105215," You do not do that with Andrew Gillum. Have you asked Andrew Gillum why he had CAIR -- the Council [ on ] American Islamic Relations -- to Tallahassee in 2016. He spoke to welcome them. They were an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation terror financing trail -- the largest terror financing trial in history. He welcomed them, he thanked them for what they were doing. Why were they in Tallahassee? To protest the anti-BDS legislation that the Legislature was doing, which was protecting our relationship with Israel. The CAIR people got kicked out of the House committees because they were saying all this anti-Semitic stuff. I don't see the media going after Andrew Gillum. What about his relationship with Dream Defenders? They support boycotting Israel. They equate Israel to an apartheid state. Oh no, [ Gillum ] gets his zone of protection. So it's a double standard. It's an attempt to create a narrative, and if I have a crowd with 500 people, how the hell am I supposed to know who's in the crowd? That's not a good way. You do not do that with Democrats. You do not look to find the most radical person in the Democrat audience. I'd like you to start doing that, [ because ] I'll tell you, it's not very difficult. I can find anti-Semites around him. I can find him doing things, but it's almost like we don't want to discuss that. I think there's definitely a path, Bill. I mean, if you remember this March 23rd date, where this kind of blew up, that was not any deadline. That was a self-imposed deadline. And what happened was, the bill really wasn't ready for primetime. You hadn't developed a consensus. You set a date to vote on it without having the consensus. And so, what's happened since then, is members are talking to each other, and really the administration, I think has done a good job. Vice President Pence has been exercising a lot of leadership to try to figure out how do we actually fulfill the promises we made to the American people, and for me the core thing that we have to do is deliver lower premiums and more choice on private insurance, because that is the reason why people dislike Obamacare because their premiums have gone up and their deductibles have gone up. So, that's really what we have to do, and I think if we can get there, I absolutely think we can pass something, relatively soon. We talk about gas prices, you guys go fill up, a lot of that cost is taxes that you're paying. Some of it is state and local, but most of it is the federal gas tax-it's supposed to build roads and bridges. That money goes up to Washington, politicians fight over it, they spend it on things other than roads and bridges, and we get back in Florida less than we send up there. So what I'm going to be fighting to do in the first part of the year when we deal with this issue, is to let states keep the money here if they want to. So, you pay at the pump here in Palm Coast, that money can go to the state - some of it will go to the federal-but the lion's share should go to the state or even to the county or city level depending on jurisdiction... The decisions that are made locally or at the state level are going to be more accountable-I know it's not perfect, state and local government-but in Washington, the most well-organized interest groups win. It was supposed to be a revolution to take back Washington. But when Ron DeSantis got elected, he couldn't wait to be part of the in-crowd. Here's just one example: DeSantis started cozying up to two defense contractors and almost immediately began taking tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from them. And then, unbelievably, even moved into a luxury, beachfront condo owned by -- you guessed it -- two defense contractors. Even DeSantis was forced to admit that this was the case. DeSantis didn't throw the bums out of Washington; He moved right in with them, and this is exactly what conservatives like us are steaming mad about. People like Ron DeSantis going to Washington, forgetting who sent them there, and then becoming part of the problem. For more information go to RonDeSantisfact.com. I've already warned companies like Airbnb that if you single out Jews in Judea and Samaria for disfavored treatment, we are going to be reviewing our BDS statures, we're going to be reviewing our relationship and we're going to act. We need to be fighting anti-Semitism on all fronts and BDS is nothing more than a cloak for anti-Semitism.... We have some of the strongest BDS legislation in the country. And that's something that as more companies take actions like this, we need to add them to our list very quickly... and so people will know that if you want to do business... with the state of Florida, we welcome that, but if you're going to join forces with BDS, that's a red line for us. And you're just going to forfeit being able to do business with the state of Florida. But man, what mileage have they gotten out of that and a lot of that is being driven by the pre"
Q8000233," First, stakeholders, particularly those who represented immigrant constituencies, noted that members of their respective communities generally distrusted the government and especially distrusted efforts by government agencies to obtain information about them. Stakeholders from California referenced the difficulty that government agencies faced obtaining any information from immigrants as part of the relief efforts after the California wildfires. These government agencies were not seeking to ascertain the citizenship status of these wildfire victims. Other stakeholders referenced the political climate generally and fears that Census responses could be used for law enforcement purposes. But no one provided evidence that reinstating a citizenship question on the decennial census would materially decrease response rates among those who generally distrusted government and government information collection efforts, disliked the current administration, or feared law enforcement. Rather, stakeholders merely identified residents who made the decision not to participate regardless of whether the census includes a citizenship question. The reinstatement of a citizenship question will not decrease the response rate of residents who already decided not to respond. We have made solid progress transforming EXCO into a leaner, more efficient company. We are asking our employees and key contractors and suppliers to do more with less. Our Board needs to set the tone at the top to do more with less and guide EXCO with a hands-on approach emphasizing total alignment with our concentrated equity ownership. EXCO's leaner Board expects to reach a consensual restructuring solution with our equity owners, secured and unsecured debt holders, gathering and transportation providers, and certain contractual counterparties. It is clearly in the best interest of all of these key parties to reach commercial solutions given the current commodity price environment. We must make more progress in restructuring EXCO's gathering and transportation contracts, and, given recent court decisions, we strongly believe our gathering and transportation providers will prefer consensual solutions that result in our contracts representing market rates for actual utilization rather than having all noncompetitive gathering and transportation contracts cancelled. Unfortunately, many governments across the globe have pursued policies that put American workers and businesses at a disadvantage. For these governments, President Trump and his administration have a clear message: It is time to rebalance your trade policies so that they are fair, free and reciprocal. Many nations express commitment to free markets while criticizing the U.S. for what they characterize as a protectionist stance. Yet these very nations engage in unfair trading practices, erect barriers to American exports, and maintain significant trade surpluses with us. They argue that our $752.5 billion trade deficit in goods last year was simply a natural and inevitable consequence of free trade. So, they contend, America should have no complaints. Our major trading partners issue frequent statements regarding their own free-trade bona fides, but do they practice what they preach? Or are they protectionists dressed in free-market clothing? ... the Census Bureau is still evolving its use of administrative records, and the Bureau does not yet have a complete administrative records data set for the entire population. Thus, using administrative records alone to provide DOJ with CVAP [ citizen voting-age population ] data would provide an incomplete picture. In the 2010 decennial census, the Census Bureau was able to match 88.6 percent of the population with what the Bureau considers credible administrative record data. While impressive, this means that more than 10 percent of the American population -- some 25 million voting age people -- would need to have their citizenship imputed by the Census Bureau. Given the scale of this number, it was imperative that another option be developed to provide a greater level of accuracy than either self-response alone or use of administrative records alone would presently provide. As promised during the campaign, President Trump is unshackling American energy with each day on the job. This has brought enormous benefit to our nation's coal communities, and will now also benefit an important international partner. Today's announcement will allow Ukraine to diversify its energy sources ahead of the coming winter, helping bolster a key strategic partner against regional pressures that seek to undermine U.S. interests. In the past, Russia has tried to choke off opposition to its ambitions by restricting the flow of natural gas to its western neighbors. Under President Trump's leadership, I look forward to working with Secretary Perry and others in industry and government to further expand American exports in support of our goals of keeping this country safe and promot"
Q15972549," Today I am signing a very good piece of legislation to improve public safety for the people of our state. For too long we've had situations where guns can be kept in the hands of individuals who are mentally unstable or deemed to be dangerous. We cannot have that situation continue to exist and I want to commend members of the general assembly for working on a bipartisan basis, they passed and today I will sign House Bill 2354 which is an emergency restraining order bill which allows judges as approached by law enforcement or family members, judges to issue restraining orders, to remove guns or prevent gun purchases from those individuals who are deemed to be dangerous to themselves or others. This is a very important step forward to increase safety for the people of our state and I'm proud to sign this legislation today. This bill continues the irresponsible practice of deferring funding decisions necessary to ensure pension fund solvency well into the future. The bill effectively makes Chicago taxpayers borrow from the pension funds at an additional cost of $18.6 billion. It's a game politicians like to play with taxpayers' dollars by delaying payments today and forcing future elected officials to deal with pension funding issues tomorrow. As all know by now, that practice led to our current pension woes across state and local pension systems. Chicago police retirees are rightfully opposed to the bill. Instead of doubling-down on our past mistakes, we must learn from them. In vetoing this bill, I stand with all Chicago taxpayers who will be saddled with higher future pension contributions if the bill were to become law. Today, Illinois Democrats made clear that their partisan agenda is more important than the future of our state. Despite being given the opportunity to set our state on the right path, Democrats in the Illinois House and Senate refused to pass a balanced budget with real lasting property tax relief. A 32% tax increase without real reform is not the answer. Illinois already has the highest property taxes in America. We have the 5th highest tax burden in the country. Democrats sent a strong message to Illinois families this evening: they are willing to push our state further into debt and destruction just to continue the corrupt, self-serving agendas of Speaker Madigan and the Chicago Machine. Choosing reform over the status quo is not easy, but with your help - we will bring back Illinois. I am proud to support Illinois House Republican Leader Jim Durkin, the House Republican Caucus and House Resolution 975. The Democrats' progressive income tax is a calculated killer: it kills jobs and businesses and, ultimately, it will kill the middle class. It has been less than a year since Illinois families were forced to begin paying for the 32% income tax hike I opposed. We need to send a message that emptying our citizens' pockets with new taxes is not the solution to our problems. Instead of forcing families to fork over more of their hard-earned money to the government through a progressive tax, let's build our economy, grow jobs and put money into their pockets. Together, we're saying `no' to the proposed progressive income tax. Teachers are our greatest asset in ensuring the future of our youth and they deserve to be well-compensated for their hard work. However, minimum pay legislation is neither the most efficient nor the most effective way to compensate our teachers. Illinois is one of only 17 states that utilize statewide teacher salary schedules to guarantee some level of minimum pay for teachers. This approach to teacher compensation both limits a school district's local control and imposes a significant unfunded mandate on school districts. Furthermore, as is well exemplified by Illinois, a salary schedule needs to constantly be updated in order to remain relevant; legislative action is not the most efficient way to maintain relevance. This ruling is pro-worker and pro-taxpayer. State employees -- union and non-union -- do tremendous work for the people of Illinois. This ruling is a great victory for our democracy, our public employees, and the taxpayers who count on us to bargain on their behalf. The significance of the court's decision will be felt not just in Illinois, but across America. It is estimated that there are 5 million public employee union members in 22 states who could be affected by today's ruling. I am proud of what we started three years ago on behalf of state employees and taxpayers. We are grateful to Mark Janus and the Liberty Justice Center for joining with me to bring this important issue to its rightful conclusion. The bill that passed in the U.S. House today continues to be of deep concern to our administration. Recent changes did not address fundamental concerns about the bill's impact on the 650,000 individuals that are part of our Medicaid expansion population, nor have those changes eased the concerns of the 350,000 people in the individual market who are dea"
Q929581," It must also be said that I rise today with no small measure of regret. Regret, because of the state of our disunion, regret because of the disrepair and destructiveness of our politics, regret because of the indecency of our discourse, regret because of the coarseness of our leadership, regret for the compromise of our moral authority, and by our -- all of our -- complicity in this alarming and dangerous state of affairs. It is time for our complicity and our accommodation of the unacceptable to end. [... ] The principles that underlie our politics, the values of our founding, are too vital to our identity and to our survival to allow them to be compromised by the requirements of politics. Because politics can make us silent when we should speak, and silence can equal complicity. I have children and grandchildren to answer to, and so, Mr. President, I will not be complicit. I decided that I will be better able to represent the people of Arizona, and to better serve my country and my conscience by freeing myself of the political consideration that consumed far too much bandwidth and would cause me to compromise far too many principles. To that end, I am announcing today that my service in the Senate will conclude at the ends of my term, in early January 2019. It is clear at this moment, that a traditional conservative who believes in limited government and free markets, who is devoted to free trade, who is pro-immigration, has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party, the party that has so long defined itself by its belief in those things. It is also clear to me for the moment, that we have given in or given up on the core principles in favor of a more viscerally satisfying anger and resentment. It was we conservatives who were largely silent when the most egregious and sustained attacks on Obama's legitimacy were leveled by marginal figures who would later be embraced and legitimized by far too many of us.... To carry on in the spring of 2017 as if what was happening was anything approaching normalcy required a determined suspension of critical faculties. And tremendous powers of denial.... If this was our Faustian bargain, then it was not worth it. If ultimately our principles were so malleable as to no longer be principles, then what was the point of political victories in the first place?... So, where should Republicans go from here? First, we shouldn't hesitate to speak out if the president `plays to the base' in ways that damage the Republican Party's ability to grow and speak to a larger audience. I'm aware that there's a segment of my party that believes that anything short of complete and unquestioning loyalty to a president who belongs to my party is unacceptable and suspect. If I have been critical, it is not because I relish criticizing the behavior of the president of the United States. If I have been critical, it is because I believe it is my obligation to do so, and as a matter and duty of conscience. The notion that one should stay silent as the norms and values that keep America strong are undermined, and as the alliances and agreements that ensure the stability of the entire world are routinely threatened by the level of thought that goes into 140 characters, the notion that we should say or do nothing in the face of such mercurial behavioral is ahistoric, and I believe, profoundly misguided. Steve was playing second base... Steve's OK, we believe. But Steve dragged himself about 15 yards off near second base onto the field. He was laying motionless out there, but we couldn't get to him until the shooting had stopped. After a time, another staffer ran in with a leg wound. He was shot in the leg. I think it was... one of Roger Williams staffers. (He) was then shot in the field and continued to run and limped into the dug out and we got a belt... Joe Barton's boy, a 10-year-old, was here. And we got him in the dugout, we put him under a bench... I got a look at the shooter. It was a man with a blue shirt... What do you make of it? I have no idea. But I got Steve Scalise's phone and I called his wife. I didn't want her to wake up and hear the news and not know what was going on. We must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country -- the personal attacks, the threats against principles, freedoms, and institutions, the flagrant disregard for truth and decency, the reckless provocations most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons, reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with the fortunes of the people that we have been elected to serve. [... ] The notion that one should stay silent as the norms and values that keep America strong are undermined and as the alliances and agreements that ensure the stability of the entire world are routinely threatened by the level of thought that goes into 140 characters -- the notion that we should say or do nothing in the face of such mercurial behavioral is ahistoric and, I believe, profoundly misguided. I can't s"
Q3090307," The junior senator from Connecticut: `The so-called sequester is another sad example of governing at its worst.' The junior senator from New Jersey: `It is brunt, brutal, and blind.' He gets bonus points for alliteration. The senior senator from Virginia: `Sequestration is stupidity on steroids.' I can make that claim about a lot of things said in this chamber. The senior senator from Washington: `We need to replace sequestration as quickly as possible.' Although apparently not if it requires a vote on the Cotton amendment. The junior senator from Minnesota: `There are a lot of people suffering needlessly because of the sequester.' And that's not a joke, even coming from him. The senior senator from New Hampshire: `The blind cuts of sequestration are not the right approach.' But by all means, let's keep them in place, rather than vote on the Cotton amendment. The senior senator from Connecticut: `The safety and strength of our nation also require that Congress eliminate the rightly-maligned sequestration straightjacket for all federal programs.' Maligned, yet not repealed. And my favorite, the senior senator from Rhode Island, the senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee: `Instead of dodging fiscal responsibility, Republicans need to help end sequestration and get back to a normal budget process.' Well, Republicans gave you a perfect example to do that, sir. And you turned it down. President Trump took a first step today toward cleaning up the mess that President Obama's unlawful amnesty left behind. President Trump is right that this amnesty would never have stood up in court. Yet, we now face a situation where 800,000 people, who were brought to our country as minors, face legal limbo. Dealing with this problem is a legislative task, not an executive-branch task. But we must recognize that codifying the DACA program will have two negative consequences: encouraging future illegal immigration with minors and allowing those 800,000 people to obtain legal status for their family members via chain migration, which rewards the very people who broke the law in the first place and further depresses working-class wages. Thus, we must mitigate these consequences by stopping the chain migration that hurts the working class and by strengthening the enforcement of our immigration laws. I've introduced legislation, the RAISE Act, that would limit the amount of low-skilled immigration coming into our country, and my colleagues have several proposals to strengthen enforcement. These should be the starting point of our discussions, and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to come up with a deal that protects American workers. I think we're moving a little bit too quickly on healthcare reform. This is a big issue. This is not like the latest spending bill that, you know, gets released on Monday night and passed on Wednesday and everybody goes home for Christmas and we live with for it for nine months. We're going to live with healthcare reform that we pass forever, or until it's changed in the far distant future. So I don't think we need to introduce legislation on Monday and have one chance to amend it on Wednesday. That's what they did with Obamacare, and that's one reason why Obamacare has seen so many people lose their insurance or lose access to their doctor despite the promises that were made. I would much sooner get healthcare reform right than get it fast. That's, after all, why we have a Congress, so 535 different people, from all regions of the country, representing different kinds of constituencies, can come together and talk at a deliberate pace, and try to reach a consensus solution that's best for the American people. So, I do not want to move in a hasty fashion. I want to get it right. I don't want to get it fast. And the Senate certainly will not just be jammed with whatever the House sends over here. in the State of the Union speech, the President threatened the United States Congress more than he threatened Iran, and that the position that the President's taken on sanctions is simply illogical. He has said that our sanctions, which the Congress drug him kicking and screaming into years ago, is what brought Iran to the table. Any time you're negotiating, you know, if he was a lawyer, you want the most leverage. So if we pass legislation that would impose new sanctions months from now if the talks break down, then that just gives the President more leverage to achieve a deal that he supposedly wants. I'm very skeptical that Ayatollah Khamenei wants them. But also, the deal is not just about sanctions. It is about Iran's nuclear program and Iran's position in the region and the world. The President says we're getting all kinds of cooperation right now that we haven't seen in years from Iran. Let's just quickly review it. Iran is propping up Bashar al-Assad's outlaw regime in Syria. An Iranian general was just discovered collaborating with Hezbollah in the Golan Heights ready to strike "
Q158813," I don't think it's about a religious test. I've never suggested that. And, honestly, if there are children, and there are elderly women, and there are people who have been vetted, the issue is not so much how many or who. The issue is how do we know who these people are? And the fact is, we're being asked to just trust the federal government, and we're being told something that is nothing less than fairy dust when they tell us that they have this wonderful process in place. These are the same people who spent half a billion dollars supposedly training Syrian rebels, and ended up training four of them for that amount of money, that gave us the Obamacare website, the explanation that was a total lie for what happened in Benghazi. These are the people that said they would get to the bottom of the IRS attack on conservatives and pro-Israel groups. And now they want us to just trust them that all the people who come here are going to behave nicely, none of them are really ISIS plants, and that we don't need to fear. We saw what happened in the streets of Paris. And I'll tell you, the people who are pushing for us to take them in, interestingly they're not pushing for them to come into their neighborhoods. I don't see people saying, `Let's send them to Martha's Vineyard, let's send them to Chappaqua, let's send them to the upper west side of Manhattan.' The people who are asking for this live behind gated communities and are generally guarded by armed guards. Well, a lot of Americans don't have that luxury, and they are not comfortable when they see the carnage in Paris, wondering is that what's coming to their neighborhood next. Yesterday morning, President Obama declared that we had `contained ISIS.' Yet a week ago, ISIS murdered 224 people aboard a Russian plane, and now Friday night, Paris was struck by a multi-layered attack that resulted in over 125 people murdered, many more wounded, and a world again left in shock. We are clearly not dealing with leashed animals or with a JV team. We're dealing with a threat to western civilization. During the debate last week, I stated that we should not admit those claiming to be Syrian refugees and was condemned by the left for that position. I was right and the events in Paris affirm that. Even the far left and politically correct government of France has closed its borders. It's time for a President who will act to protect Americans, not just talk and protect the image of Islam. I call for the following: Close our borders instead of Guantanamo. Institute an immediate moratorium on admission to those persons from countries where there is strong presence of ISIS or Al-Qaeda. Build a coalition that will include NATO, Russia, and nations of the Middle East to aggressively destroy ISIS. Nations who refuse to participate will be sanctioned and isolated. Revoke any agreement with Iran regarding their nuclear capacity. Radical Islamists, whether Sunni or Shia, are a clear and present danger to civilization. I would put a big focus on the people who are most likely to commit this kind of activity. And if people have been traveling to the Middle East, and there's indications that there is radicalization, you know, then I'd put the focus on them. I wouldn't go put the focus on Tucker Carlson and be afraid that he's going to go crazy on us one day. I just don't understand why the president thinks that if you disarm every law-abiding citizen, that somehow that makes us safer when someone breaks into our home, or breaks into our office building, and sprays us with bullets.... And this is the way the left always constructs the argument is that it was too easy to get a gun. Well, part of that is because, you know, you have people who came to this country with visas, they came with passports. If this woman was in fact, a radical when she came and radicalized her husband, then I'd like to ask, not so much why should we take Tucker's gun or my gun away? But why didn't we do a better job of vetting this person, and now you want to bring several hundred thousand refugees to this country, and we don't know really who they are? That's why Americans are just in a rage. We feel like our government is working against us, rather than trying to protect us. This is really about the survival of Western civilization. This is not just a little conflict with a Middle Eastern country that we've just now given over $100 billion to, the equivalent in U.S. terms is $5 trillion. This threatens Israel immediately, this threatens the entire Middle East, but it threatens the United States of America. And we can't treat a nuclear Iranian government as if it is just some government that would like to have power. This is a government for 36 years has killed Americans, they kidnapped Americans, they have maimed Americans. They have sponsored terrorist groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, and they threaten the very essence of Western civilization. At the end of my presidency I would like to believe that the world would"
Q16106910," The legislature had a chance to do the right thing for North Carolina today, and they failed. I am disappointed that Republican legislative leaders refused to live up to their promise to fully repeal House Bill 2. I'm disappointed for the people of North Carolina -- the jobs that they may not get. I'm disappointed that we haven't yet removed the stain from our reputation around the country and around the world. People want us to work together for the good of our state. I know there were enough Democratic and Republican votes to fully repeal HB 2 by itself. But Republican legislative leaders have broken their word to me and broken their trust with the people. My staff and I worked day and night through the past week to forge an agreement that would bring back jobs and sporting events. For the first time ever on this issue, we had House Republican leaders, Senate Republican leaders, Senate Democrats, House Democrats, the Charlotte City Council, business leaders, sports leaders and the LGBT leaders in agreement. The Charlotte City Council held up its end of the deal by repealing its ordinance. When it came time for Republican legislative leaders to do their job, they failed. This was our best chance. This cannot be our last chance. It has been a difficult 72 hours for Charlotte. Yesterday, I met and spoke with Mayor Roberts, faith and community leaders, law enforcement and national guard officials in Charlotte and I am deeply grateful for all the work they are doing to keep people and property safe. The question this morning is where do we go from here? We must continue in the pursuit of the truth while also continuing the important work of bringing our communities and law enforcement together to build trust and safety for all. One step toward meeting both goals is for the videos in this case to be released to the public. Transparency between the community and our law enforcement breaks down barriers and brings progress. As Attorney General I have witnessed first hand the honorable work that our officers do everyday and I am grateful for their hard work and sacrifice. I also know that many in our community feel disproportionately targeted and yearn to be heard and respected. Everyone is safer when there is mutual respect between law enforcement and our communities and working for that mutual respect is critical. The legislature swatted the other two branches of state government at once last week -- quite a feat, even for this overly aggressive body. House Bill 239 reduces the N.C. Court of Appeals from 15 judges to 12 through attrition. The next three who leave the bench won't be replaced. The measure was approved with the support of all Republicans in the House and Senate over opposition from Democrats. It denies Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper the chance to fill vacancies, starting next month when Republican Judge Doug McCullough reaches the mandatory retirement age of 72. Two more Republicans, Robert N. Hunter Jr. and Ann Marie Calabria, would be next to retire, both in 2019. Cooper could be expected to replace all three with Democrats if he had the opportunity. Partisan politics aside, this move will have a major impact on the state's appellate courts -- and it was made without consultation with judicial officials. That creates the strong suspicion that the changes were not made with partisan politics aside. After briefing with all hospital systems throughout the State earlier today, it's clear that the cases are increasing at a rapid rate. Personal protective equipment and supplies are running low in nearly every region of the State. We cannot afford to be led by a false sense of security created by a low number of confirmed cases. We do not have the luxury to think and act based on human time. COVID-19 follows its own timeline and pathway. Because of limited availability of tests and high-throughput technology, we do not have the date to fully understand the magnitude or timing of the surge. We expect to see a continued multiplying effect until the state implements a Shelter in Place directive. It is imperative that we move quickly, as it will take at least two weeks after a shelter in place order is issued before we see a change in the trajectory of cases. Hospital and physicians throughout the State believe this is the only resort left to immediately impact the growth and spread of the virus. Having heard the updated information relative to schools remaining closed until the middle of May, NCHSAA interscholastic athletics will remain suspended until at least May 18. The NCHSAA Board of Directors and staff will use the next few weeks to weigh our future decisions based on the new directions given by Governor Cooper, other government leaders, and organizations charged with public health and safety during this unprecedented time. Such decisions will include the possible resumption of spring sports' competition and the possibility of holding the state basketball championships. While we remain hopeful that we w"
Q381157," None of us will ever forget the events of September 11th. That day, we peered into the face of evil. But for all the evil we witnessed, we saw good in equal measure. We saw fortitude in our firefighters and policemen who sacrificed all. We saw strength in our leaders and soldiers who stood ready to respond. On that day, the cowardice of our enemies only magnified the courage of our heroes, and in every instance of villainy, we responded with acts of valor. I am acutely aware of that danger and the terrorist activities that continue to threaten our country. I do not believe in negotiating with terrorists, nor do I believe in appeasing nations that propagate terrorism abroad. For that reason, I expressed my resolute opposition to the President's Iran nuclear deal this week. Iran's leaders embody the very hatred that led to the attacks of September 11. For that reason alone, I cannot support a deal that releases vast sums of money to the regime, which it can use to support terrorist groups, such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Fourteen years after the events of September 11, the terrorist threat has not receded. If anything, it has grown stronger. I remain committed to protecting this nation against all terrorist threats, which is why I oppose the President's Iran deal. A robust and balanced Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement holds the potential to enhance our economy by unlocking foreign markets for American exports and producing higher-paying jobs here at home. But a poor deal risks losing a historic opportunity to break down trade barriers for American made products with a trade block representing 40 percent of the global economy. Closing a deal is an achievement for our nation only if it works for the American people and can pass Congress by meeting the high-standard objectives laid out in bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority. While the details are still emerging, unfortunately I am afraid this deal appears to fall woefully short. Over the next several days and months, I will carefully examine the agreement to determine whether our trade negotiators have diligently followed the law so that this trade agreement meets Congress's criteria and increases opportunity for American businesses and workers. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a once in a lifetime opportunity and the United States should not settle for a mediocre deal that fails to set high-standard trade rules in the Asia-Pacific region for years to come. Medicare Advantage is a crucial program for our seniors, and I applaud CMS for making a number of payment and policy adjustments since the release of the Advance Notice and Draft Call Letter this past February. Many of the revisions were championed by members of the Finance Committee and will help ensure the program continues to offer high quality, affordable health care plan options for our seniors, including an overwhelming majority of Medicare beneficiaries in Puerto Rico that use MA plans. While I'm pleased by the progress CMS is making to improve this vital program, I remain hopeful the agency considers requests to enhance transparency and predictability of the Fee-for-Service Normalization Factor. I look forward to more carefully reviewing these final policies for the 2018 plan year, and continuing to work with the agency in the future to address this, and other issues, so our seniors can continue to enjoy the benefits Medicare Advantage provides. I know that most of us here on the committee share the desire to reform our nation's broken tax code. And, in my view, one of our goals in tax reform should be to create more permanence in our tax system so that individuals, families, and businesses don't have to wonder whether the tax code is going to change from year to year. Toward that end, I believe we should be working to make a number of these tax extender provisions permanent. The House has passed several bills that would do just that, and I think there are enough votes here in the Senate to do the same, at least with regard to some of the more important provisions. However, for the sake of making this markup less contentious and to ensure we can more quickly provide much needed relief to taxpayers, I've agreed to defer litigating the issue of permanence until a later time. But, make no mistake, as Chairman of this committee, my goal is to see many of these provisions made permanent. Did any of these individuals stop to ask themselves why Facebook and Google don't charge for access? Nothing in life is free? Everything involves tradeoffs. If you want something without having to pay money for it, you're going to have to pay for it in some other way, it seems to me. And that's what we're seeing here. And these great websites that don't charge for access, they extract value in some other way. And there's nothing wrong with that as long as they are up front in what they are doing. In my mind, the issue here is transparency. It's consumer choice. Do consumers understand what they're agreeing to when they a"
Q11153," My answer, I think is, no, because usually no matter how complex and involved the legal issue, the case may seem, it implicates a broader legal question about, you know, the statute may be complicated, but the question is going to be, well, how do you go about reading the statute, what sources do you look at in a particular case. We don't take technical legal cases because we like technical legal cases. They're usually because they implicate a broader question. When I was practicing law, this is a speech I gave a lot of times, because I was not an expert in any area of the law. I like to think of myself as somebody who was good arguing in a particular court, in the Supreme Court, and so I'd have to, you know, convince someone who comes in with an important trademark case, who could hire the world's leading expert in trademark law, or me. And, I would tell them, look, the Supreme Court does not think your case is a big deal for trademark law. It thinks your case is a big deal for how regulations relate to the statute, how particular provisions in the statute should be read. So, you need somebody who, you know, can look at it in that broader perspective that the justices do, and you know, I would say, half of the time, they would say, well, I actually want somebody who knows something about trademark law, and that was understandable, but, then it would be, and, you know, they would get there in front of the Court, and they're too expert in trademark law, and the justices just aren't that interested in a lot of those nuances, and sometimes they would just be speaking over each other. The Government urges us in this case to uphold a direct prohibition on political speech. It asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concern. Its theory, if accepted, would empower the Government to prohibit newspapers from running editorials or opinion pieces supporting or opposing candidates for office, so long as the newspapers were owned by corporations -- as the major ones are. First Amendment rights could be confined to individuals, subverting the vibrant public discourse that is at the foundation of our democracy. The Court properly rejects that theory, and I join its opinion in full. The First Amendment protects more than just the individual on a soapbox and the lonely pamphleteer... [ C ] areful consideration convinces me that Congress violates the First Amendment when it decrees that some speakers may not engage in political speech at election time, when it matters most. From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice. I hope that you will suffer betrayal, because that will teach you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time so that you don't take friends for granted. I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life, and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you'll be ignored so that you know the importance of listening to others, and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion. Whether I wish these things or not, they're going to happen. And whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your misfortunes. From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice. I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time so that you don't take friends for granted. I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then, your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you'll be ignored so you know the importance of listening to others, and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion. Whether I wish these things or not, they're going to happen. And whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your misfortunes. Nothing in the text or history of the Takings Clause, or our precedents, suggests that the rule is any different when it comes"

When we open our hearts to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice, no place for bigotry and no tolerance for hate. The young men and women we send to fight our wars abroad deserve to return to a country that is not at war with itself at home. We cannot remain a force for peace in the world if we are not at peace with each other. As we send our bravest to defeat our enemies overseas -- and we will always win -- let us find the courage to heal our divisions within. Let us make a simple promise to the men and women we ask to fight in our name, that when they return home from battle, they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as one. But the Trump kids' lemonade stands weren't like most other kids' lemonade stands. `First of all, my mother wasn't about to let us set up shop with a lemonade stand at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street -- and to do so in the lobby of Trump Tower would have been just a little too precious, don't you think?' ... So they made an arrangement to set up shop one summer at their house in Greenwich, Connecticut. Ivanka writes that she and her brothers used their `wily charms and persuasive marketing skills' to get their bodyguard, their parents' driver, and some of the household staff to buy enough lemonade to cover their expenses. `They took pity on us and dug deep for their spare change,' she said. It used to be when my mother was at work, she was at work, and when she was at home, she was home, and there wasn't tremendous overlap between the two functions. That doesn't exist anymore. I'm at home playing with my kids and then jumping into the other room to take a conference call at 8 o'clock at night. I'm in the office and I'm calling in to check on my kids as they're leaving school or arriving at school. There's this continuity that didn't exist before, and technology has enabled it to be really one life rather than a siloed experience of the working woman and what she looks like in the office versus the woman who's staying at home with her children. Now it's all blended. Two of America's biggest steel manufacturers -- both with deep ties to administration officials -- have successfully objected to hundreds of requests by American companies that buy foreign steel to exempt themselves from President Trump's stiff metal tariffs. They have argued that the imported products are readily available from American steel manufacturers. Charlotte-based Nucor, which financed a documentary film made by a top trade adviser to Mr. Trump, and Pittsburgh-based United States Steel, which has previously employed several top administration officials, have objected to 1,600 exemption requests filed with the Commerce Department over the past several months. When I had the idea for my brand, I realized I was going to have a much steeper learning curve in fashion than I did in real estate, which I had been exposed to my whole life. So I was proactive and met with people in the industry who had created or worked at companies I respected -- Tory Burch, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, and Calvin Klein, of the established players; Warby Parker, Reformation, and Everlane, of the new guard, to name a few. I sought out their wisdom and experience in trying to understand a business that I had never planned on entering and pepped them with questions about design, product, teams, business models, and infrastructure. Honestly, I wasn't treating myself to a m"

You have no idea. I think, for me, the first thing that really jumped out was this defense. I know statistically the numbers aren't what you would think of as far as great numbers, though when I watch this defense those numbers don't match up because it's a salty defense. They play hard, they're aggressive. Every once in a while there will be a big play given up, but overall I was shocked to see the stats because I think we got our hands full with this defense. They're all over the place. They've got big run stoppers in the middle, they've got good edge rushers, (Robert) Mathis, they got two backers in the middle that are very active and good players. Vontae Davis is a shutdown corner so that was the first thing that jumped out and the other thing offensively is, I know there have been a number of injuries but you still, with (Donte) Moncrief and T.Y. (Hilton), that's a lot of speed on the field. Hasselbeck has done this thing for a long time and he's seen enough football in his time that he can still hurt you. That's what makes us better, that's what makes the challenge I think of guys playing this game. That's why they play, because they are highly competitive and they do want the ball. I haven't been around a good receiver that doesn't, or a back that doesn't want to carry it. That's the way it's supposed to be, those guys are wired that way. But I do think that there is a delicate balancing act between the two. Our guys, maybe they may want it more, and I'm sure they do. One catch certainly would not suffice, but they know how to temper it and balance it within the context of our team. That's what I think is extremely important. I want them to want it, I want them to want in the worst way, every single week. Diehard in practice and make certain that they perform well. I think that part of it we want, but it has not been a problem in terms of distraction with our team, and we preach that, we talk about it. It's always good to kind of get the first one under your belt and I thought our guys did a number of things that were certainly encouraging. From a defensive standpoint, did a nice job in terms of keeping them out of the endzone. Anytime you have a preseason game it's very difficult to hold a team to no touchdowns and they were able to do so. Did a nice job with a little bit of bend and don't break sort of, couple series in there, but overall thought they tackled well and did a pretty good job. But yet obviously we still got a lot of work to do. Offensively, I thought we ran the ball decently. The offensive line did a nice job in there as well as the backs carrying the ball. Three quarterbacks all had scoring drives at one point or another, which I think was good, but we still got a lot of work to do. But things were at least encouraging. I'll open up for any questions. We just didn't play well in any area. We just didn't play well from an offensive standpoint, a couple of interceptions early on and they scored off those interceptions. Then we just could not get anything going. We were running the ball decently early but then obviously the score kind of got away from us and it became more of a passing game. Didn't do a great job in terms of our protection. A couple guys came free, a couple guys just got flat-out beat on a couple of occasions. But we expect to"

Q182788," nobody's going to be perfect.... I mean, if you picked the most perfect member of the Freedom Caucus, and you put them in charge of the House. within two weeks, half the Freedom Caucus will be mad at them, and half the rest of the conference will be mad at them. So just start with -- these are troubled times. These are times that produce a Ben Carson, a Carly Fiorina, a Donald Trump, and, on the other side, a [ Sen. ] Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and we need to understand, people -- if -- you can't set a standard of perfection, that nobody's going to meet that standard. But [ what ] you can say is, here's the question I would ask, before they pick a speaker, and Paul Ryan is a very, very smart guy, and if he wants to run, I suspect he'll probably win partly because people are frightened right now, and they all want to rush to get... to a decision, rather than stop and think, because it scares them to be in this level of turmoil, and the news media is beating on them and saying, you've got to do something right now, or it will look terrible, and you'll be really bad, which is, by the way, all baloney, the election's over a year off. Don't worry about it. Try to think through what the right thing is. But I'll tell you, what I would ask of any potential speaker is, tell me your strategy. Explain to me how you're going to bring the Republicans together in the House. Explain to me how you're going to stand up to the Senate, and explain to me how you're going to curtail the most unconstitutional president in history? Well, you know, the most recent survey that Gallup did by 60 to 32, the American people want a smaller federal government. They're not getting it. You look at people who believe the in the 2nd Amendment, you have a president who's consistently violating the Constitution, who's now suggesting by executive order, he's going to impose various forms of gun control that he could never get through the Congress. Every time you turn around, there is something more outrageous coming out of Washington, and the Republicans don't seem to be capable of organizing a successful opposition. and I think i'm very sympathetic to the problems that [ Speaker Rep. ] John Boehner (R-OH) had. I don't know, frankly, that anybody could have done a much better job. But I think what you're seeing has to be put in context. The Freedom Caucus is a symptom of a much deeper anger in the country. They're a symptom of the Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, [ Sen. ] Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who between them, have about 60% of the vote of the Republican primary, and I think the Washington establishment, whether it's the K Street lobbyists, it's news media or it's the Republican members of the House and Senate need to understand, we're in the middle of a historic change, not just politics as usual, and the country is increasingly angry. Well, look, first of all, I think the key challenge here, and I would say this to [ Rep. ] Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) who is probably the smartest, the most disciplined person in the House, and who is the obvious person for everyone to turn to. This is not about personality. You had Eric Cantor knocked out in a primary by a stunning margin, and [ Rep. ] Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), by the way, his successor's put out a very good list of the first ten things House Republicans should do, well worth looking at. You've had Speaker Boehner, who reached a conclusion that it was too expensive and too painful to keep fighting. You had [ Rep. ] Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), who I was for, I thought was the logical next speaker. You had him just now stop, and people better understand this is not about finding a magic personality. The Republicans need to slow down. They need to go into a number of day-long conferences where they honestly listen to each other. Every one of those 247 won an election. Every one of them deserves to be heard. But then you can say to every one of them, `Now you have to listen to the rest of us, too.' And they've got to come up with a strategy, which moves us towards the values of the American people, and which successfully takes on Barack Obama and curtails him as an unconstitutional president. Here are the two great secrets of being a failure in Washington. The first is to allow the Senate, in which the Democrats are far more ruthless, and far more willing to stop anything, to become the definer of the fight. And the second is to be afraid to take the president on constitutionally. I read this piece this morning. They talked about the catastrophic 2013 shutdown. One of the most successful Republican elections in history was 2014. Highest number of House members since 1928, took control of the US senate. Largest number of state legislators since -- in the history of the party, since 1856, largest number. Yet, this Washington reporter says this was a catastrophic shutdown. Give me three more catastrophes, and we'll control everything. I mean, we have to understand Ronald Reagan didn't look at weekl"

I voted to confirm Judge Kavanaugh because of his 26 years of distinguished public service and his reputation as a superior jurist, lawyer and teacher. It would be fundamentally unfair and a dangerous precedent not to confirm him because of an uncorroborated alleged sexual assault 36 years ago. Between 1993 and 2018 the FBI interviewed nearly 150 persons in six separate background checks of Judge Kavanaugh. I have reviewed the results of these background checks. It appears that in every interview the FBI asked whether the interviewee was aware of alcohol or prescription drug abuse by Judge Kavanaugh. Not one person interviewed said they knew of such a problem or of inappropriate sexual behavior. I also reviewed the seventh background check involving Judge Kavanaugh, which was conducted earlier this week. It confirmed that the only person who remembers the incident Dr. Ford alleges is Dr. Ford, including the four others she said were present, each of whom stated under penalty of felony that it didn't happen or that they don't remember any such incident. Senate Democrats have treated Judge Kavanaugh as innocent until nominated. They have victimized him and Dr. Ford and their families. They have diminished the United States Senate and its confirmation process by their embarrassing irresponsibility. Our nation cannot ignore these mass shootings. That is why last year I helped pass a new law to eliminate loopholes in the background check system for gun purchasers. Two years ago, I helped rewrite federal mental health laws to improve the quality and coordination of mental health care, focusing on early intervention. New laws I co-sponsored gave schools more funds to stop school violence and to meet the needs of students with mental health disorders. I am ready to do more, especially on background checks, to identify those who shouldn't have guns. Toda"

I'm sick and tired of putting these asses in office and as an independent I couldn't vote in the primary. I joined the Republican party so I can vote in the primary against Jeb Bush. Have you looked at Common Core?... My assessment is that Jeb Bush is a progressive. His stance on the border is that we don't have a right to sovereignty in America. He sees people invading our country as an act of love. I am Hispanic and I grew up here. But when welfare started, we began to get a different breed of Mexicans, some of them who didn't want to work and try to milk the system for as much as they can get. I guarantee you that there are a lot who come up here and they get jobs if they're not working for free and they're not working for minimum wage. They are not working for Taco Bell and they're not picking cotton. Big getting jobs in scaffold builders, insulators, concrete pourers and they are making anywhere from $40,000 - $80,000 a year. And their families are picking up welfare, and they're claiming 10 or 12 dependents in Mexico when they file. This is tearing up our country. Anybody who `hems and haws' about this has lost me. What built America's called the American system, from Hamilton to Polk to Henry Clay to Lincoln to the Roosevelts. A system of protection of our manufacturing, financial system that lends to manufacturers, OK, and the control of our borders. Economic nationalism is what this country was built on. The American system. Right? We go back to that. We look after our own. We look after our citizen, we look after our manufacturing base, and guess what? This country's gon na be greater, more united, more powerful than it's ever been. And it's not -- this is not astrophysics. OK? And by the way, that's every nationality, every race, every religion, every sexual preference. As long as you're a citizen of our country. As long as you're an American citizen, you're part of this populist, economic nationalist movement. The very first meetings we had with the Republican establishment, here was the plan that was laid out. The plan was to do Obamacare because, remember, Paul Ryan and these guys come in and said, `We've done this for seven years. We've voted on this 50 times. We understand this issue better than anybody. We know how to repeal and we know how to replace, and this is ours. That's what we're going to start with day one, and we will have something on your desk by Easter. By the Easter break, we'll do repeal and replace. Come back from Easter, and all the way up to the August break, taxes. Come back from the summer break, on Labor Day, and we drive home to the end of the year on infrastructure. We accomplish all three big legislative goals in the first year, ' seven of the nine richest counties in the United States of America surround Washington, D.C. For the first time since the invention of the Silicon ship, Washington, D.C., those seven counties have a higher per-cap income than Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley, which by the way has led the greatest revolution in technology in man's history, and had more great inventions. Now what does Washington, D.C., have?

Q186215," Here's what we should do and I don't think the [ GOP ] leadership is going to do. When we get back, we can send the House and the Senate a bill that funds the government and says that if you're an able-bodied person and if you're getting American people's tax dollars you have to do something to get that money. That should be in the bill, along with a simple thing, here's the money for the wall, start building the wall. Put those two things in it and then send it to the Senate and then for a month. And this is always what Republicans are afraid to do, for a month debate, we have a guy in the White House that's pretty good at taking a message to the American people. He wants this wall, and he also wants people who are able-bodied [ to work ], I've been touring my district the last week, and every single employer I talk to says that they're finding it difficult to find employees, to find people to work. That's because we have too many people who do not work, who are on welfare, who are able-bodied and could be working. It's not only good for the economy, it's good for our employers, it's also good for those people stuck on the welfare system. So do those two things and have the debate. Instead, what we always do is forfeit before we even kick the ball and play the game. Every time Mr. Koskinen comes to testify, we subsequently learn that something he said wasn't accurate. So you go back to last year, we first had a subpoena requesting all information regarding the targeting of conservative groups. There was also a preservation order to protect all the documents that were part of the targeting of conservative groups. His chief council knew in February of last year they had missing e-mails and problems with Lois Lerner's hard drive. So John Koskinen comes in front of our committee March 26 last year, and assures the committee they will get us all the information, all the emails, all the documents. And yet three weeks before he said that, just three weeks before, earlier is that same month, they already destroyed 422 tapes. So there's a preservation order and subpoena to make sure we get the information. The preservation order said keep the information, protect the information and the IRS destroys it. Three weeks later John Koskinen testifies we're going to get it to you. Those kind of actions are something we have to look into seriously. That's what the committee is doing. We must push the envelope. We want to get rid of community ratings and include flexible age categories. There should be health savings accounts, keeping your child on your health insurance until age 26, and portability. Regarding the high-risk pool, we should support something similar to what Maine has done. Those with serious illnesses would not have their premiums raised, but [ be ] moved into the high-risk pool anonymously, where the taxpayer will help out. There should be reform of how Medicaid operates with a work requirement for the Medicaid expansion population. Pre-existing conditions should be covered, which is why we all support Congressman Sanford's replacement legislation. It says if you maintained consecutive coverage, you will not be denied; otherwise, you must wait two years to have that pre-existing condition covered. You have to enroll. On the other hand, you can't have people wait until they get sick and expect to be covered. It is like wanting to buy fire insurance while your house is burning up. The idea is to reward individual responsibility. The transcript speaks for itself.... The two guys on the call have both been very clear, no pressure, no pushing, no linkage to investigations, both President Zelensky and President Trump have said, and of course, President Zelensky didn't pledge to do any investigations prior to the aid being released, and the Ukrainians didn't know that the aid was even on hold at the time of the call. Their two -- their first two witnesses, neither one of them's ever talked to the president, talked to Chief of Staff Mulvaney, or talked with Mayor Giuliani. And as I said with Ambassador Taylor, he had three meetings with President Zelensky, and all three of those meetings, never once did this idea of linking security assistance dollars to an investigation ever come up. And of course, we know what President Zelensky said, no pledge, no promise, no starting of any investigations prior to the aid being released. So, again, I think this is a sad chapter for the country, but, frankly, a good day for the facts and a good day for the president of the United States. The frustration is twofold, I think, for Americans. It's one, that people get elected and don't do what they told their voters they were going to do, so that is one of the frustrations so many Americans feel. Things that we campaigned on and things that we were elected to do, the mandate was set in the election, enough of those things aren't getting done. So that's part of the frustration. The second big frustration is that there appears to be,"
Q1363468," These God-given gifts are part of what makes Ohio truly wonderful. We need to protect our natural wonders. Water is virtually important for every Ohio citizen no matter where they live in Ohio. We have an aging infrastructure, failing septic systems, pollution, and lead contamination. Communities face different and unique water problems. Our water problems have increased over the years and it is going to take a commitment and long term solutions to protect water for our children and grandchildren. We are going to create a new fund, the H 2 Fund to ensure safe water all across the state of Ohio. We can't continue to lurch from water crisis to water crisis. The fund will give us the ability to plan and develop long term solutions. The right thing is not always the easy thing to do. It will not be easy or inexpensive, but the cost of doing it now will be far lower than not doing it at all. We must make a real commitment not only to water quality but to all our natural resources. We need an energy strategy that will not only ensure that Ohio's economy remains competitive but also generates clean electricity that lights our homes and powers our businesses.... My greatest desire is to work hand in hand with each of you to finish our unfinished business. I know through Ohio grit and determination and by undertaking bold, daring, and transformative efforts we will move Ohio forward. Every year thousands of Ohio children under age 6 test positive for unsafe lead levels, and I can say undoubtedly there are countless others who, if tested, would test positive. In 2017 we lost over 1,000 babies in Ohio who died in their first 12 months in life. Further African American babies are dying at almost 3 times the rate of white babies, leaving Ohio ranked the 39th worst in the nation for deaths of infants. This must stop. We must work together to do it. Children are also experiencing trauma living with abuse, neglect, living with a person who is doing drugs.... We will increase our state's investment in children services agencies and intervention and prevention services that can help children flourish. Many Ohioans are still dying daily from unintentional drug overdoses. I have instructed my health and human services teams to focus every day on these public health issues. The focus will be on people, and they will work with you the members of the General Assembly, and they will work with their partners and counterparts on the local level where services are truly delivered and rendered. If you have ideas or your constituents have ideas share them with them. We want your thoughts, your ideas, and your good judgment. So my attitude throughout this has been let's get the facts. I keep asking the questions. I try to find everybody or anybody who knows anything about this and try to learn from them and then base my decisions on that. The other thing I've learned throughout life is that when I don't trust my gut, when other people are going one way and I think well, I probably ought to go this way and then I end up going with them, I'm usually wrong. So I've learned to trust my gut. My instinct throughout this has been, and this is based on what the experts have told me, but my gut has been we're not moving fast enough. We've just got to move faster and so that's my message to my team every day. We've got to move faster. As John Wayne said in one of his movies, `We're burning daylight and we're running out of time.' And we got to get this right. We've got to move quick. When you talk to employers, the No. 1 complaint today is, `I can't find people to work.' Two reasons: one is a drug problem, one is a skills gap. If you look at the five or six programs we've laid out, they focus on this. Let's take the drug problem, first of all. I have a comprehensive 12-point plan. There's nothing magical about it, but it all takes things that will work or are working -- the drug courts, for example. They work. Probably the most important of the 12 points is education and prevention. The evidence shows if you start in Kindergarten and do something every single year, K-12, in regard to prevention, you will fundamentally change outcomes. We're not doing that very much. We're doing a DARE program here, something else here. Those are all fine, but if you really are serious, you've got to do something every single year, Look, we're all dealing with the same problem. We do not have enough tests. We don't have the testing capacity, but that's a nationwide problem. It's a real challenge and of course, now what we're looking for is making sure as the surge comes, this wave comes at us, we know it's coming, to make sure that we do everything we can to build out our hospitals. We think we may have to double the size of our beds, number of our beds. At the same time making sure our medical personnel have the personal protective gear that they really, really need to have. And so we've stopped all elective surgeries in Ohio, for example, we've asked dentists t"
Q1280288," Obviously, we all are thinking about Justice Scalia and his family and the personal side of this tragedy. But it's going to be a massive impact on the debate tonight, on the Republican race, and I think you're going to see a lot of Republicans lining up behind what Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has said, what Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has said. In part because, as you know, as well as me, Ted Cruz's mentor, John Roberts, is just the latest in a long list of justices that many conservatives believe said one thing when they were, before they became justices, and another after they became justices. Antonin Scalia was the exception to that rule. And as you know, you can go back to Earl Warren, which Ike said was the biggest mistake he made in his life, Justice Brennan, liberal stalwarts appointed by Republican justices. Of course, Blackmun, author of Roe v. Wade, appointed by a Republican. And we could go down the list, all the way through Souter. And so conservatives, Republicans, are more sensitive to this issue than anything else. They also understand the right to keep and bear arms, the way they interpret the Second Amendment is, you know, it's a 5-4 decision. And so there are so many things that rest on who the next justice is going to be. Isn't it something that every president, every campaign will have their closing arguments and you can go back. Whether it was Barack Obama, or whether it was Ronald Reagan, whoever was running for president, they always had -- and their party always had -- their closing argument: `This is why you should re-elect us. This is why you should keep us in power. This is our message. This is who we are.' Now, in normal times the Republicans would use that tax cut that they passed. That was supposed to be their closing argument. Or perhaps the Supreme Court justices, or perhaps Donald Trump bragging about re-making the judiciary -- of course, lying -- saying he's appointed more judges than any other president since George Washington. You could go down the line of things you would expect -- the economy -- this president to use as his closing argument. But what Donald Trump and what the Republican Party -- which has now been completely taken over by Donald Trump -- is using is racism. And you see it in Donald Trump saying he's going to circumvent the Constitution with an executive order. He can't do that. He knows he can't. He's hoping there's enough stupid voters out there that don't understand he can't do that. [ Trump ] is completely detached from reality. We had a New York Times and a Washington Post piece saying so a couple of days ago. And the question is, Mika: If this is not what the 25th Amendment was drafted for... I would like the cabinet members -- serving America, not the president; serving America. You serve America and you know it. You know you don't serve Donald J. Trump. Scam developer. Scam, you know, Trump University proprietor. Reality TV show host. You don't represent him. You represent 320 million people whose lives are literally in your hands. And we are facing a showdown with a nuclear power and you have somebody inside the White House that the New York Daily News says is mentally unfit. That people close to him say is mentally unfit. People close to him during the campaign told me [ he ] had early stages of dementia. Now listen, you can get mad at me if you want to... But it is ok to say... When are we supposed to say this? After the first nuclear missile goes? Is that when it's proper to bring this up in polite society? [ J ] ust let's look back at this week. You had Donald Trump enraged by some events earlier, the leaving of -- Hope Hicks' announcement that she was leaving, a testimony that didn't go so well, the House Intel Committee, several other things crashing at the same time. And the news reports were, out of the White House, that the president was angry, and so, he just struck out and decided to push tariffs, and he did it without talking to any of his economic advisers. He lost his most able economic adviser, Gary Cohn. And then fast-forward a couple of days, and the president is consumed in the story of a payoff to a porn star, which now we're hearing, he was angry at his press secretary for mistakenly telling the truth. And suddenly, you have the foreign policy community shocked and caught off guard by the most significant announcement a commander-in-chief could make in 2018. So, tariffs, and North Korea, all to distract from a president that didn't go through the proper channels, or use the proper interagency processes once. I just - you know, one of the things - one of the versus in the Bible that always-always makes me a little nervous before I start judging other people is the one that says that you will be judged and you will be given the mercy that you show others. I think we should all step back and ask whether we are so perfect that we want to be the ones to cast that first stone. Let ye who is without sin cast the first stone. I'm in no pos"
Q7384672," create a new path for energy dominance in Reuters, the U.S. is soon expected to produce 10 million barrels of oil per day. The U.S. ranks third in the world in oil production. This move has been praised by oil executives and lobbyists. Thomas J. Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, said that because coastal land is taxpayer-owned, it should be open to. drilling However, Pyle is the one of the few people to praise this action. Governors from many coastal states on the Pacific and Atlantic seaboard have criticized the changes in the offshore drilling proposals. Republican Gov. Rick Scott of Florida said he wanted to remove the coastal water off of Florida from this. plan The governors' concern is valid. Offshore drilling can have a huge impact on the environment. In 2010, Deepwater Horizon, an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, exploded. This caused the deaths of 11 workers and spilled 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Oil was found in all of the states that bordered the decades. American families deserve a health care system that works; and that means it has to be affordable and accessible, while still preserving a high quality of care and innovation. Earlier this month, we learned that the major health insurance companies in Montana are raising rates on some of their ObamaCare plans. Taking care of our neighbors and staying healthy should not be a partisan issue. We all agree there will need to be some level of help for folks who face difficult situations, but ObamaCare simply does not work for the vast majority. For too long Senator Harry Reid has threatened to block any bipartisan health care reform, and President Obama has maintained he will veto any law to repeal or even roll back the most flawed parts of ObamaCare. I urge them to come to the table. Let's work together on health care solutions that truly lower costs, expand coverage, and protect the doctor-patient relationship. It's what Montana families deserve. Rep. Rankin was a true Montanan, embodying the pioneer spirit we know and love. Rankin led the way for women in both STEM and politics. She was the first woman ever elected to the House of Representatives, and that was at a time in our nation when many women didn't even have the right to vote. She was a famously spirited debater and leading women's suffrage advocate. Not being content blazing trails in just one field, Rankin was also a gifted scientific mind having graduated from the University of Montana with a biology degree. This grant program is an important tool for young women of today to continue their education in STEM and possibly break new ground and blaze new trails for the young women of tomorrow. I am proud to have one of Rep. Rankin's relatives continuing the tradition of service to Montana on my staff and I thank Congresswoman Meng for leading this bipartisan effort with me. In Montana, if your basement fills with water, you don't raise the ceiling to let more water in; you pump the water out. That's the analogy I use to explain why just raising the debt ceiling doesn't make sense. Simply raising the debt limit to allow the federal government to accumulate more debt without actually having a plan to pay off the debt and balance the budget is not a serious plan and doesn't solve the problem. I want to see a balanced budget amendment, and if Congress doesn't pass a balanced budget, they shouldn't get paid. The people of Montana sent me to Washington to get things done and help right the course. Voting for this bill would do nothing to put our nation on track to good financial health, and it would be a slap in the face to every Montanan who works hard every day to make a good living for themselves and their families. Every dollar spent to rebuild our parks will help bolster the gateway communities that rely on park visitation for economic vitality. I want to thank the American people who made their voices heard through the public comment process on the original fee proposal. Your input has helped us develop a balanced plan that focuses on modest increases at the 117 fee-charging parks as opposed to larger increases proposed for 17 highly-visited national parks. The $11.6 billion maintenance backlog isn't going to be solved overnight and will require a multi-tiered approach as we work to provide badly needed revenue to repair infrastructure. This is just one of the ways we are carrying out our commitment to ensure that national parks remain world class destinations that provide an excellent value for families from all income levels. Normally, when you do a land use project, we normally NEPA. The Antiquities Act is the exception. Again, we don't have to go through legislative process; the President determines it, and it does not have to go through NEPA. In this case, the administration, as you all know, has heard from members of Congress and states and, in some cases, the designation of the monuments may have resulted in loss of jobs, reduced wages and reduced"
Q472241," We understand the concerns from Congregation Kol Ami and want to put them and anyone else at ease. We are respectful of the neighborhood and are committed to ensure any cannabis scent generated from our property doesn't impact our neighbors. We screened countless air filtration proposals and selected a system that specializes in local capture -- similar to what's used in a luxury Las Vegas hotel, chemical lab, or hospital. In addition to the custom air filtration system we are planting air purifying and odor absorbing landscaping as an additional precaution. We will have two patios and our street facing patio (closest Congregation Kol Ami) will be for our non-smoking guests. We understand the end of cannabis prohibition and the new kinds of businesses that are created from it ending can be scary. We intend to show that an establishment which allows for cannabis consumption can be as great a neighbor as any other business. We welcome the concerns and support of the neighborhood as we know all of this is uncharted. Our Committee Members work tirelessly to create a more accountable government that puts needs of taxpayers and our local communities first. The House took a huge step forward tonight in delivering further relief for patients by permanently repealing ObamacareÂ's job - and innovation-killing Medical Device Tax. We also passed many important bills today that will develop a more transparent and efficient health care system, increase accountability at the IRS, improve service at the Social Security Administration, and improve the tax rules affecting water infrastructure. I want to thank all of our Members for their hard work on these valuable measures, especially Committee Members Devin Nunes, Dave Reichert, Erik Paulsen, Mike Kelly, Kristi Noem, David Schweikert, Mike Bishop, John Larson, Ron Kind, and Suzan DelBene, along with Reps. Ken Buck, Rodney Davis, and John Moolenaar. I look forward to further action on this legislation in the Senate. Â This is an exciting day for the millions of Americans who are tired of today's broken tax code and have waited for years for better job opportunities, more take-home pay, and a stronger economy. Today, House Republicans joined President Trump and our Senate colleagues in letting the American people know: we're taking action. After years of work, we are moving forward with a unified framework that paves the way for bold, transformational tax reform -- tax reform that will bring more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks. We have a lot of work ahead. But this moment marks a major step forward in the process. Now it's time for the Ways and Means Committee to build on this momentum and deliver legislation that President Trump can ultimately sign into law. We are closer than ever to finishing what we have started for the American people -- and 2017 is our year to make it happen. Our families and workers deserved better than that slow growth status quo. And now, thanks in large part to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the economic outlook for America has dramatically improved. Already in the first quarter of 2018 we are seeing actual growth of 2.9 percent. And CBO projects that this will accelerate to 3.3 percent by the end of 2018. Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, CBO projected investment would grow to 4.4 percent in the first quarter of 2018 -- after tax reform, CBO revised its projection to 5.6 percent for that same quarter. And the data now shows that investment actually grew 6.1 percent in the first quarter of 2018 -- even higher than CBO's revised projection. Looking forward, CBO has also estimated that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will create 900,000 jobs, raise wages by $1.2 trillion, and boost investment by $600 billion. Thank you to President Trump for signing this historic legislation, which is the biggest and boldest step in over 20 years to redesign and restructure the IRS into an agency with a singular mission -- quality taxpayer service. This bipartisan law requires the IRS to submit to Congress in 2020 a plan to redesign the agency so that it serves taxpayers first. For the first time, it puts into law a truly independent appeals process so our taxpayers claims are heard fairly. It also levels the playing field to ensure taxpayers have the same information as the agency, better protects our taxpayers information, and reins in past IRS abuses to guarantee families and local businesses never have to fear having their accounts and property seized without fair and due process. I've been visiting with Secretary Mnuchin and Acting Commissioner Kautter on the best path forward as well. But to be clear, circumstances have changed at the IRS. This is an agency that for years has mismanaged its funds, has a terrible record of customer service, fraud and abuse in the system, and they failed to protect taxpayer information. Now, we have a new tax code, a new Acting Commissioner, who first wants to make sure they're using existing resources the right way, but secondl"
Q22360," The Congress has failed. â €  Eager for a conclusion, Trump's allies nevertheless suggested the shift in timing to extend the proceedings into next week, acknowledging the significance of the moment for senators who want to give final speeches. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made the offer to Schumer, but it was not yet final. Under the proposal, the Senate would resume Monday for final arguments, with time Monday and Tuesday for senators to speak. The final voting would be Wednesday. To bring the trial toward a conclusion, Trump's attorneys argued the House had already heard from 17 witnesses and presented its 28,578-page report to the Senate. They warned against prolonging it even further after House impeached Trump largely along party lines after less than thee months of formal proceedings making it the quickest, most partisan presidential impeachment in U.S. history. Some senators pointed to the importance of the moment. â € œWhat do you want your place in history to be? â €  asked one of the House managers, Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a former Army Ranger. Trump is almost assured of eventual acquittal with the Senate nowhere near the 67 votes needed for conviction and removal. To hear more witnesses, it would have taken four Republicans to break with the 53-seat majority and join with all Democrats in demanding more testimony. But that effort fell short. Chief Justice John Roberts, in the rare role presiding over the impeachment trial, could break a tie, but that seems unlikely. Asked late Friday, he told senators it would be â € œinappropriate. â €  Murkowski noted in announcing her decision that she did not want to drag the chief justice into the partisan fray. Though protesters stood outside the Capitol, few visitors have been watching from the Senate galleries. Bolton's forthcoming book contends he personally heard Trump say he wanted military aid withheld from Ukraine until it agreed to investigate the Bidens. Trump denies saying such a thing. The White House has blocked its officials from testifying in the proceedings and objected that there are â € œsignificant amounts of classified information Charlie Weimer found a home on the Kenai Peninsula in 1984 and over the past 30 plus years he has continually demonstrated a level of dedicated service to the local community rivaled by few. Truly, there are few organizations and businesses in our community that haven't had the opportunity to work with Charlie firsthand and benefited from his service. A regular volunteer with numerous organizations, you can often find Charlie quietly working away at lunch at the Kenai Peninsula Food Bank or spending an evening or weekend at an event at the Soldotna Senior Center. He has the reputation as someone `just gets it done.' Whether that means rounding up donations and financial support, gathering volunteers or rolling up his sleeves and getting to work himself. His commonsense, honest and trustworthy approach to his career in banking as well as his significant volunteerism in the community over the years has been appreciated by all. The Kenai Peninsula has been fortunate to benefit from Charlie Weimer's contributions over the past 30 some years and hopefully will continue to do so for many years to come, I've been pressing the Defense Department to articulate its strategy for defending U.S. interests in the Arctic for years. We are beginning to see the Pentagon take our Arctic role seriously, but we need to know what it is that we are up against with both Russia and China increasing their interest and activity in the region. My amendment to this defense bill requires that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the State Department and the Intelligence Community, provide Congress with a timely assessment of Russian and Chinese activities with military implications in the Arctic. This will enable policy makers to better understand whether the Defense Department is moving quickly enough to address longstanding deficiencies in our ability to protect and defend our interests in the Arctic region. I also made it a priority to address the disproportionately high rates of suicide among servicemembers and their families. It's our duty to provide for the security of our nation and to do all we can to support those who protect it, I voted no on the healthcare proposal last night because both sides must do better on process and substance. The Affordable Care Act remains a flawed law that I am committed to reforming with a structure that works better for all Americans. But to do that, the Senate must fully devote itself to an effort to improve the healthcare system in this country, reduce costs, increase access, and deliver the quality of care that our families want and deserve. I know that access to affordable care is a challenge for so many. I hear from fishermen who can't afford the coverage that they have, small business owners who can't afford insurance at all, and those who have gained coverage for the"
Q37084447," if you're going to punish and fine employers, you have to have a Justice Department and an Obama [ administration ] -- a presidential administration that'll follow through. I would do that. But I think I have a better idea, and I was hopeful that it would be in this document. There's room for it within the language that's there, it's not specified, it's called the New IDEA Act. And that's a piece of legislation that I offered, several cycles ago, that does this. It brings the IRS into play, and it tell -- and it says this, `If you're an employer, and you use E-Verify, you get safe harbor for those that you hire. But, you cannot be left the wages and benefits paid to illegals under this legislation.' And so, the IRS would go through, under a normal audit of a business, and they would run the Social Security numbers of the employees through. If E-Verify kicks them out, and says, `Sorry, they can't work in the United States,' then the employer would lose his business deduction. So, your $10 an hour illegal, after there's interest, penalty, and taxes charged on that, becomes a $16 an hour illegal. And we would -- and there's a six year statute of limitations on it. So, we would clean up this workforce, and we'd do so with the IRS. And we require the IRS to cooperate with the Social Security Administration, and the Department of Homeland Security. I know that's within the -- I'll say within the list of things that Donald Trump would be looking at to support, but I don't -- but it's not in the document. So, that's what I would do. I think it's actually -- it enhances our revenue stream. It's a -- it would score out a plus by billions of dollars, and clean up our workforce. Sequel has been a fantastic partner for Alaris over the past several years. Alaris has created another incredible outcome for the entrepreneur by buying out the original private equity sponsor, financing accretive acquisitions as well as buying out minority shareholders during our partnership. By limiting our annual growth and also our exit participation, we have allowed the entrepreneur to enjoy an unprecedented financial result. At the same time, Alaris shareholders received exactly what we targeted, a very steady revenue stream and market leading returns. Our internal rate of return on Sequel will come in at 23% per annum, not including foreign exchange gains. Including foreign exchange, our IRR on this partnership increases to 29%. These results are at the very high end of private equity return expectations, particularly in the currently overheated competitive environment and are consistent with our 13 year track record of returns on partnership exits. While losing a large revenue stream is not our goal, the premium we receive allows us to redeploy the capital very profitably and without requiring equity or debt financing for our next transactions. We are pleased to say that we expect the Sequel revenue to be replaced accretively with new partnerships that are currently in process and exclusive to Alaris. We do not expect any reduction in our revenue expectations for the year but will have a stronger balance sheet with the excess cash that will remain from the Sequel proceeds, Wow, what a stunning hour or a little bit better took place here in the United States Congress today, just a little bit earlier, this morning. The long saga of three years and one month of trying to come up with an excuse to impeach Donald Trump has finally come to pass. The excuses are this: `Abuse of Power' and `Obstruction of Congress.' The `Obstruction of Congress' charge is this: that Donald Trump didn't make it easy enough for Democrats to come up with a reason to impeach him. They've been determined to do that for three years and a month. Then they'll define what that `obstruction' actually is. The second thing is `Abuse of Power.' If this charge of `Abuse of Power' is impeachable, that means that you can impeach any President at any time as soon as you disagree with what he's done with his foreign policy. That's the scenario that is here. There are 4 reasons to impeach a President: Treason - they fell flat there, no treason on Donald Trump's part; Bribery - they talked about it. They can't make that stick either, so that fell in a flop; High Crimes-no High Crimes either. This is down to misdemeanor, and their minutiae definitions of misdemeanor because they have politically decided to impeach this President. And if they do so, they will set a standard, a low standard for impeachment, that will cause it to happen over and over again going forward. As part of our ongoing inquiries we have arrested a 51-year-old man from the West Midlands on suspicion of selling non-medicinal poison.

Q926069," I had the opportunity to watch the hearing today and listened carefully to both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh testify. I believe allegations of sexual assault should be taken very seriously, and Dr. Ford deserved the opportunity to tell her story and be heard. I believe my job is to assess the facts that we have before us, and that's very difficult when no corroboration exists regarding this allegation. Judge Kavanaugh has adamantly denied the allegation. The only three others named by Dr. Ford as being present, including Leland Keyser, who Dr. Ford described as one of her lifelong friends, have no recollection of this event or this party. In fact, Ms. Keyser says she was never at a party with Brett Kavanaugh and, in fact, does not know Brett Kavanaugh. Dozens of men and women who knew Brett Kavanaugh in high school have attested to his good character. This includes 65 women who knew him at that time who wrote a letter saying the Brett Kavanaugh they knew treated women with decency and respect. In America, there is a presumption of innocence when there is no evidence to corroborate a charge. Throughout his decades of public service, Judge Kavanaugh has been thoroughly vetted by the FBI on six different occasions, and no such allegation ever surfaced. I have known Judge Kavanaugh for more than 15 years, I know his wife Ashley, and I know his family. The Brett Kavanaugh I know is a man of integrity and humility. He also has the right qualifications and experience to serve on the Supreme Court. In fact, the American Bar Association has given him their highest rating, unanimously. I support his confirmation. The process should include criminal penalties for those who bring false or frivolous charges. An order should only be granted when a judge makes the determination, by clear and convincing evidence, that the person poses a significant risk of danger to themselves or others. The process should require the judge to make a determination of whether the person meets the state standard for involuntary commitment. Where the standard for involuntary commitment is met, this should be the course of action taken. If an ERPO is granted, the person should receive community-based mental health treatment as a condition of the ERPO. Any ex parte proceeding should include admitting the individual for treatment. A person's Second Amendment rights should only be temporarily deprived after a hearing before a judge, in which the person has notice of the hearing and is given an opportunity to offer evidence on his or her behalf. There should be a mechanism in place for the return of firearms upon termination of an ERPO, when a person is ordered to relinquish their firearms as a condition of the order. The ERPO process should allow an individual to challenge or terminate the order, with full due process protections in place. The process should allow firearms to be retained by law-abiding third parties, local law enforcement, or a federally licensed firearms dealer when an individual is ordered to relinquish such firearms as a condition of the ERPO. The individual must also have the ability to sell his or her firearms in a reasonable time without violating the order. The issue of marriage equality is one that divides people of principle, and I understand that. In 2013, I decided to support marriage equality after I came to understand this issue better in the context of my own family. I can't help but view today's Supreme Court decision through that same lens. And as a father, I welcome today's decision. Although the United States now becomes the 20th nation with legal same-sex marriage, it stands in stark contrast to much of the rest of the world, my colleague Saeed Kamali Dehghan (Fewer than 1 billion of the world's population live in countries where same-sex marriage or civil unions are recognised, compared to almost 2.8 billion living in countries which criminalise gay people and impose severe punishments on homosexuality, such as imprisonment, lashings and even death sentences. gay marriage map Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, said that the LGBT community makes for a ready and often tragic scapegoat in many nations. LGBT people are also convenient scapegoats for embattled leaders, who are trying to rally support from more conservative sectors of their society. Whether it's Uganda, Nigeria or Russia, the decision to scapegoat the LGBT community is an outcome of serious challenges to the regime, for widespread corruption or abusive authoritarianism. Ashley, I think they can. There is an overwhelming sense among Republicans that the status quo is not acceptable and it needs to be replaced, but obviously the question is how. And I think the House ultimately will probably get the votes. Then it comes over here to the Senate. There will be changes made in the Senate. Already, there is discussion of taking some of the House provisions that were met as a placeholder and filling those out further, particularly"
Q7437083," This measure adds Section 38 to Article II of the Oklahoma Constitution. The new Section creates constitutional rights. It creates the following guaranteed rights to engage in farming and ranching: The right to make use of agricultural technology. The right to make use of livestock procedures. The right to make use of ranching practices. These constitutional rights receive extra protection under this measure that not all constitutional rights receive. This extra protection is a limit on lawmakers' ability to interfere with the exercise of these rights. Under this extra protection, no law can interfere with these rights, unless the law is justified by a compelling state interest-a clearly identified state interest of the highest order. Additionally, the law must be necessary to serve that compelling state interest. The measure and the protections identified above do not apply to and do not impact state laws applied to trespass, eminent domain, dominance of mineral interests, easements, right of way or other property rights and any state statutes and political subdivision ordinances enacted before December 31, 2014. The Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling was wrong because it ignored the profound historical impact of the Ten Commandments and contradicted previous decisions of the court. The court previously upheld as constitutional a 50-foot tall lighted cross on public property and blessed the construction of a chapel at a state-owned orphanage. Now, the court is bucking its own precedent and misconstruing a section of the state Constitution that permitted those displays to order the removal of the privately funded Ten Commandments display. This ruling has implications far beyond the placement of the monument. If the court is going to ignore its own precedent and interpret the state Constitution differently than before, then state Medicaid dollars spent at religiously affiliated hospitals and state scholarships used at religiously affiliated colleges and universities could be in jeopardy. We are asking the court to grant our petition for rehearing so we can defend the placement of the Ten Commandments monument and head off the damaging impact of this ruling on other issues. I would say that there are climate exaggerators. In fact, many of you -- I don't know if you saw this article or not, but the Climate of Complete Certainty, by Bret Stephens, that was in the New York -- the New York Times talked about -- and I'll just read a quote, because I think it's a very important quote from this -- from this article. FILE - In this June 2, 2017, file photo, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt speaks to the media during the daily briefing in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington. President Donald Trump and his Cabinet often avoid talking about the science of climate change, but when pressed what they have said clashes with established mainstream science, data and peer-reviewed studies and reports. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) There are scientists that agree. There are scientists who don't agree to the extent of man's contribution, and what's even harmful at this point. We've had ebb and flow. We've had obviously, climate conditions change throughout our history. That's scientific fact. It gets cooler, it gets hotter. We don't know the trajectory, if it is on an unsustainable course. Nor do we know the extent by which the burning of fossil fuels, man's contribution to that, is making this far worse than it is. In fact, studies show in the last decade or so, that carbon emissions are actually down. The United States has done a tremendous amount of work to lower those carbon emissions. Water is a shared resource, so finding a way to work together was vitally important. I commend the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations and City of Oklahoma City for working purposefully and tirelessly with the State over the past five years to reach an equitable agreement. The State retains its permitting authority over water in the Settlement Area, which is important since uniform permitting and administration provide certainty and consistency for the management and use of water resources. When finalized, the agreement will protect existing rights and provide certainty for future uses in southeastern Oklahoma and other areas of the state. As he enters his second year in charge of the EPA, Pruitt is distinguishing himself from his predecessors in ways that go beyond policy differences. His travel practices -- which tend to be secretive, costly and frequent -- are integral to how he approaches his role. Pruitt tends to bring a larger entourage of political advisers on his trips than past administrators. But while the aides usually fly coach, according to travel vouchers through August obtained by The Washington Post separately from the Environmental Integrity Project, he often sits in first or business class, which previous administrators typically eschewed. The cost of Oklahoma's workers' compensation system was on"
Q5300433," The votes have been counted and the result is clear. This is a huge victory for public education in Arizona. After years of lawsuits and fighting, we are moving forward and funding our teachers, students and schools -- instead of lawyers. Thanks to the voters, schools will soon see a cash infusion, with billions of new dollars flowing in the years ahead. This will make the difference in the lives of kids and teachers all across this state, and that can't be understated. These are the resources educators have been telling us they need, and by coming together and working together, we were able to make it happen. Many said we should have waited until November, when passage would have been easier. Special election turnout presents unique challenges, and this is certainly the most difficult political environment anyone can recall. However, the schools needed money now, so we took the harder path because it was the right thing to do. I'm gratified that it paid off, with a majority saying yes, and now schools will see funds as early as next month. I want to thank all the teachers, parents, education champions, business leaders and elected leaders on both sides of the aisle who worked tirelessly to advocate for this proposition. This was truly a broad, bipartisan coalition that brought individuals together who don't always agree. While this campaign is over, that spirit should live on in all we do, especially when it comes to education. John McCain is one American who will never be forgotten. He was a giant. An icon. An American hero. But here at home, we were most proud to call him a fellow Arizonan. Like so many of us, he was not born here, but his spirit, service and fierce independence shaped the state with which he became synonymous. Angela and I join all Arizonans in praying for Cindy and the entire McCain family during this difficult time and offering our full support. As we mourn his passing and celebrate his truly phenomenal life, we're also faced with the void John McCain's absence leaves in the heart and soul of our nation. John McCain fought for America every day -- from the Navy through Vietnam to the U.S. Senate. He fought for what he thought was right, even when it wasn't popular. His dogged patriotism and passion for country made him an inspiration, and a model, for all of us. John McCain was about more than politics. He brought us above partisanship and challenged us to be great. He once told us, `We're Americans, and we never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history.' May his life and legacy continue to inspire us to build a future for this country, and a history for this country, that would make John McCain proud. A dad. A husband. A giant of the NFL and an Arizona icon -- Bill Bidwill never forgot he was part of our community, and he showed it throughout his long and remarkable life. Bill was passionate about many things, but especially his faith, family and the Cardinals football team he loved so much. He served his nation in the U.S. Navy and gave back generously to his community, starting and advancing numerous charities. Bill brought the Cardinals to Arizona over three decades ago, helping pioneer Arizona's professional sports identity. He was pivotal to bringing Arizona's first Super Bowl to the state in 1996, as well as two more in 2008 and 2015. He stood out among NFL owners for his kindness, good nature and leadership, and was an early proponent of bringing more diversity into the team's front office. Living to the age of 88, with five children, 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild, his was a life truly well lived -- and his impact and legacy will love on. My deepest condolences go out to the entire Bidwill family during this difficult time. Distracted driving is a growing problem in Arizona and nationally. I generally believe that public awareness and education campaigns are a more effective remedy to prevent accidents and save lives than blanket laws that let politicians feel like they've checked the box, and then move on to the next issue. For that reason, I am skeptical of large-scale bans on texting while driving-I just don't think they work. But this bill is different. The state already regulates a number of things when it comes to early driving by teens. And for good reason. For our youth, these laws can act as a teacher. In fact, I'd be in favor of a law that goes further, banning texting while driving for all minors. Driving is a privilege for our youth, and they are still the responsibility of their parents, financially and otherwise, before the age of 18. If we can use the early years of their driving experience as an opportunity to guide them toward safe and responsible habits, that's a good thing. Given the horrifying events in Paris last week, I am calling for an immediate halt in the placement of any new refugees in Arizona. As governor, I am invoking our state's right under 8 USC, Section 1522 (a), to receive immediate consultation by fede"
Q4716651," Today's actions are another step by the FDA and HHS to eliminate every possible barrier to the all-of-America approach that President Trump has called for. With this boost from the FDA, medical device makers can more easily make changes to existing products, such as changes to suppliers or materials, to help address current manufacturing limitations or supply shortages. Other manufacturers, such as auto makers, can more easily repurpose production lines to help increase supply. Hospitals and other health care providers can repurpose machines they have now to serve as ventilators. HHS and FDA's message is clear: If you want to help expand production of ventilators to save American lives in this pandemic, we are going to work with you to sweep every possible barrier out of your way. All of us at HHS are proud of the remarkable work Commissioner Gottlieb has done at the FDA. He has been an exemplary public health leader, aggressive advocate for American patients, and passionate promoter of innovation. I will personally miss working with Scott on the important goals we share, and I know that is true for so many other members of the HHS family. Scott's leadership inspired historic results from the FDA team, which delivered record approvals of both innovative treatments and affordable generic drugs, while advancing important policies to confront opioid addiction, tobacco and youth e-cigarette use, chronic disease, and more.

The public health of our country is better off for the work Scott and the entire FDA team have done over the last two years I commend President Trump for delivering a speech that celebrated the economic boom we have seen under his leadership, which has brought new opportunity and prosperity to the American people. A healthier economy means a healthier America, and we look forward to more such success in the coming year, including through reforms to make healthcare more affordable and accessible for all Americans. The President also deserves tremendous credit for his leadership in addressing the opioid crisis that's hitting communities all across America. During his first year in office, President Trump has brought a new level of awareness and commitment to this cause, and I look forward to expanding and enhancing our aggressive approach to this scourge of addiction and overdose. Invoking the Defense Production Act to secure ventilator production from GM and other companies is a part of President Trump's all-of-America approach to combating the coronavirus. By rating contracts under the DPA, HHS is helping manufacturers like GM get the supplies they need to produce ventilators as quickly as possible, while also ensuring that these ventilators are routed through the Strategic National Stockpile to where they're needed most. The Trump Administration has deployed thousands of ventilators from the Strategic National Stockpile that have helped save lives in hotspots such as New York so far. We're grateful to the GM team for working with the federal government to expand our nation's supply of ventilators as the pandemic evolves. Secretary Alex Azar. Alex, I'm very proud of what you've done. And you're coming up in about another month with health care. Maybe even sooner than that. We're going to have a great health care bill planned. And it's going to be great health care for a much smaller price than anybody ever thought possible. And I really appreciate that. And our new project that we're really working on very hard is reducing the cost of prescription medicine. And that's going to be something that people will not forget. Some people think that's almost more important than the health care. I've had people say, `Which is more important?' They're both important. But we're reducing the cost of medicine because of what you're doing, and we appreciate it. Numerous problems with the Trump administration's testing regimen have come to light: Coronavirus tests developed by CDC were flawed, possibly because the lab itself was contaminated. The resulting lack of test capacity forced U.S. officials to screen a limited number of patients across January and February, with the CDC testing fewer than 500 Americans at the same time that China was likel"
Q4898286," I'm not for or against one type or one brand of school choice. I'm not for any type of school over another. Sycophants of the `system' would have you believe choice means vouchers [ and charter schools ], right? They say it means private schools, or maybe even religious schools. It means for-profit schools. They say it means taking money away from [ traditional ] public schools -- no accountability, no standards, the wild west, the market run amuck... Yet nothing could be further from the truth! You see, choice is not just another wonky policy debate or a pedagogical theory or a statute written by politicians to be parsed out by lawyers. The real meaning of choice is that it is every parent's right to determine how to engage their children in their own life-long learning journey. States are different, families are dynamic, and children are unique... That's why I wholeheartedly believe real choice cannot be accomplished through a one-size-fits-all federal government mandate!... But D.C. does have an important supporting role to play in the future of choice. We can amplify the voices of those who only want better for their kids. We can assist states that are working to further empower parents, and we can urge those that haven't to start [ doing so ]. The Education Choice and Competition Index is important, and unique, because it's very parent-centric. Parents are the first and primary point of accountability. The report makes the distinction that simply having a choice program is not enough: It must be accessible, transparent and accountable to those who need it most... (D) istricts (such) as Mobile, Alabama, nominally provide choice but don't give parents adequate tools to take advantage of the program. As a parent, you can't take advantage of a choice you don't know exists. We need to find ways of better connecting citizens to the information they need. The report notes that Mobile is not alone: 26 other districts, nearly a quarter of those surveyed, receive a letter grade of F on the report's scale -- meaning they provide few to no tangible school options. There is clearly a long way to go for many school districts, and I'm hopeful that this report will help light a fire under them to better serve students. I am hopeful this report helps lights a fire under [ low-scoring cities ] to better serve students. And while we may be tempted to emulate cities with a higher grade, I would urge a careful look. The two highest-scoring districts, Denver and New Orleans, both receive As. But they arrive there in very different ways. New Orleans provides a large number of choices to parents. All of its public schools are charters, there is a good supply of affordable private schools, and the state provides vouchers for low-income students to attend private schools if they choose. Combined with its easy-to-use common application, New Orleans' sophisticated matching system maximizes parental preference and school assignment. Meanwhile, Denver scored well because of the single application process for both charter and traditional public schools, as well as a website that allows parents to make side-by-side comparisons of schools. But the simple process masks the limited choices there. Tonight, the President delivered a strong message in support of America's students and their futures. Every student, parent and teacher should be excited by this bold agenda to free them from a government system that limits their success... President Trump is ensuring these forgotten students are forgotten no more. This Administration wants every American, no matter their age, income, zip code or stage in life, to have access to K-12 and higher education options that work for them, unlock their individual potential, and help them pursue successful careers in our booming economy. That's evidenced by the President's strong commitment to career and technical education and apprenticeship expansion, higher education reform, Second Chance Pell expansion, and Education Freedom Scholarships. I think we're saying that, for every school that she can point out where there's a public school that's a dead end, you can probably point out a private school that's also a dead end for a kid who needs a better education. So our point here would be a policy that essentially gave families vouchers, and allowed them to go use those vouchers for tuition in any private school. And remember, I talked about how heterogeneous these private schools are: In any private school, that kind of policy is not likely to add much value to kids' achievement long term for the large number of kids that need help in the United States, and particularly a policy like that without oversight, that would determine what type of school a child might go to -- whether it was actually a decent one or not. I urge the NEA to do the right thing and stop blocking the Department's efforts to delay the 2016 State Authorization Distance Education regulation so that students enrolled in distance educa"
Q539493," I have been used to this for the last three years. The House Intelligence Committee Republicans, we continue to expose Democrat corruption over and over again. And what always happens is right when we expose them, what do they do? They go out to kill the messenger. So this week another fake news story. The problem with this week's fake news story, then we actually caught him. And we caught them badly and also involves criminal activity and so what we are going to do, I gave a statement on Friday night, we are going to take both CNN and the Daily Beast likely into federal court right after Thanksgiving. And we hope to cooperate because were also going to be working with the appropriate law enforcement authorities because it is not okay to work with someone who has been indicted on serious federal crime to build a media narrative and dirty up a member of Congress. You've seen it, the American people have seen it over the last three years. We out them, and then they, with the media narrative to try to dirty up the people who are doing the work on behalf of the American people. We hope that CNN and the Daily Beast will cooperate with the court, they should comply with the subpoenas once we file this and go through different depositions. It should be fun. Hey, Rob, uhm, this is John again. Uh, maybe, I-I-I - `m-I'm sympathetic; I understand your situation, but let me see if I can't... state it in... starker terms. If you have... and it wouldn't surprise me if you've gone on to make a deal with, and, uh, work with the government, uh... I understand that you can't join the joint defense; so that's one thing. If, on the other hand, we have, there's information that... implicates the President, then we've got a national security issue, or maybe a national security issue, I don't know... some issue, we got to-we got to deal with, not only for the President, but for the country. So... uh... you know, then-then, you know, we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of... protecting all our interests, if we can, without you having to give up any... confidential information. So, uhm, and if it's the former, then, you know, remember what we've always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains, but -- Well, in any event, uhm, let me know, and, uh, I appreciate your listening and taking the time. Thanks, Pal. They got caught orchestrating this entire farce with the whistleblower and lying about their secret meetings with him. They got caught defending the false allegations of the Steele dossier which was paid for by them. They got caught breaking their promise that impeachment would only go forward with bipartisan support because of how damaging it is to the American people. They got caught running a sham impeachment process featuring secret depositions, hidden transcripts and an unending flood of Democrat leaks to the media. They got caught trying to obtain nude photos of President Trump from Russian pranksters pretending to be Ukrainians. And they got caught covering up for Alexandra Chalupa, a Democratic National Committee operative who colluded with Russians to try to smear the campaign by redacting her name from deposition transcripts and refusing to let Americans hear her testimony as a witness in these proceedings. Several leftwing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics. The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power. Despite the baselessness of the charges, I believe it is in the best interests of the House Intelligence Committee and the Congress for me to have Representative Mike Conaway, with assistance from Representatives Trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney, temporarily take charge of the Committee's Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee looks into this matter. I will continue to fulfil all my other responsibilities as Committee Chairman, and I am requesting to speak to the Ethics Committee at the earliest possible opportunity in order to expedite the dismissal of these false claims. They now are regulating the content, and they're deciding how to regulate the content -- and it's clearly biased against conservatives. So we are looking at them for operating their property in a negligent way, and then we're suing others for defamation. Look, this is not the way I want to go about it, especially for someone like me. I don't like going to have to use the court system, but it's really the system of last resort. And that's where I'm at. If you go right now -- don't do it because I don't use Google, and I don't ask people to use Google -- but if you did, you'd find hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of fake news stories about me. The only way I can clean all this up is to have multiple retractions done by the defamers and the slanderers."
Q256380," Iran and Planned Parenthood. One has something to do with the defense of security of this nation. The other has something to do with the defense of the character of this nation. You have not heard a plan about Iran from any politician up here, here's my plan. On day one in the Oval Office I will make two phone calls, the first to my good friend Bibi Netanyahu to reassure him we will stand with the state of Israel. The second to the supreme leader, to tell him, unless and until he opens every military and every nuclear facility to real any time, anywhere inspections by our people, not his, we the United States of america will make it as difficult as possible to move money around the global financial system, we can do that, we don't need anyone's cooperation to do it, and every ally and every adversary we have in this world will know that the United States of America is back in the leadership business, which is how we must stand with our allies. As regard Planned Parenthood, anyone who has watched this videotape, I dare, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain. This is about the character of our nation, and if we will not stand up and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us. I find it fascinating that Planned Parenthood, EMILY's List and the rest of the pro-abortion lobby are now suddenly so concerned about a heavily edited video. I don't recall them ever being concerned about a heavily edited video of Mitt Romney at a fund-raiser. I don't remember them being concerned about Edward Snowden. We've had a lot of things where information has come out that we needed to see. So instead of going after the people who have put out this video information we clearly need to see, let's talk about the issue here. Of course they're trying to change the subject. Of course they're trying to say this is life saving research. I find it amazing that this group of pro-abortion lobbyists continue to say that they are protecting women's health. Really? late-term abortion is bad for women's health. They continue to lobby against parental notification. Really? It's protecting a teenager's health that she can go to a tanning salon or a tattoo with her mother's permission but get an abortion without her mother's permission? This is not about someone else's health. This is about a woman's health. A woman's opportunity to have all of the choices in front of her and it's about a life that she is bearing. You know, I think the word feminism, let's just back up for a moment, to me, a feminist is a woman who chooses her own life. The life she chooses could be to have five children and stay home and homeschool them. The life she chooses could be to go on to work. But a woman should have the opportunity to choose her own life. Unfortunately, these words get politicized, and the word feminist got politicized by the National Organization for Women, and NOW is clearly a political organization. They want to put forward a particular political agenda. So, for example, Hillary Clinton during the 2014 elections said, when she was campaigning against Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) for Bruce Braley, she said, `well, it's not enough to be a woman, you have to be a woman who believes,' and she then went on and listed the liberal orthodoxy. And that is how these folks think, that unless you fit their orthodoxy, you don't count as a woman, you don't count as an African-American, you don't count as a Hispanic. And of course, that's ridiculous. We need to take gender and race out of all these conversations, we need to unify the nation once again. But Hillary Clinton will try to make gender the issue in her election. You know, I'm a conservative, Maria, because I know that no one of us is any better than any other one of us. Each one of us has God-given gifts. Every one of us has the capacity to live a life of dignity and purpose and meaning. Progressive policies have failed so many communities, and in particular, progressive policies have failed African-American communities. And so, we need to provide the opportunities, in every community, for someone to find and use their God-given gifts. It's why it's important to get this economy going and growing again. We have to, in particular, disentangle people's lives from the webs of dependence that government has woven around them for decades, that do not encourage them to move forward in their lives, but discourage them from doing so. We need to make sure that every single child has a real chance to be educated, absolutely important. All of these things must happen, but we need to go back to a fundamental, that every American is worthy, and that we cannot leave a single American behind, regardless of their circumstances, regardless of their race. I would do very specific things. First, instead of having a Camp David conference to talk our Arab allies into"
Q887111," Michigan's continued reinvention and economic growth depend on talented individuals choosing to live and work here. It is essential for State government to be a leader in welcoming all people to our state and ensuring that everyone is treated fairly and with respect. The State of Michigan must be open for business to all. It is critically important to this Administration that State government maintains its leadership position in encouraging robust and inclusive economic growth. State government is one of the largest buyers of goods and services in Michigan, and therefore it is uniquely positioned to be a leader in ensuring fair treatment for people in employment. In fact, it already has been a leader. With respect to State employees, the Civil Service Commission adopted Civil Service Rule 1-8.1 prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation for State departments and agencies subject to Civil Service Rules. For Michigan to be a leader in inclusive economic development, all State of Michigan departments and agencies that perform procurement functions and provide loans and grants to local units of government and private entities must work together to ensure State government is open to everyone. Over the past six years, we've worked hard to attract talent and close the skills gap, including in the hi-tech world, and have created nearly 500,000 private-sector jobs. Michigan also has a strong public/private partnership dedicated to working together to build statewide student proficiency in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. And as a global leader in design and engineering, we are proud to be home to the most FIRST Robotics teams in the U.S. -- a national program that offers high schoolers the opportunity to work side-by-side with professional engineers to build, design and program robots that battle one another. We hope to build on these efforts to continue to grow a talented workforce and hi-tech industry within Michigan. Colonel Etue posted something on social media that was inappropriate. She immediately apologized and has acted to demonstrate that apology, including facilitating meetings with various groups to hear concerns and to share the work the Michigan State Police does in cities and neighborhoods statewide to connect with the communities they serve and recruit new troopers from all backgrounds. I have full faith in Col. Etue's leadership as the commander of the Michigan State Police, which I believe to be the best law enforcement body in the nation. The Colonel has served honorably as an enlisted trooper for 30 years, and I hope we can come together as Michiganders to move forward and find common ground, rather than rehash past mistakes. You just keep working. You just keep working on putting solutions in place and moving forward, and that's what's been happening. We're seeing a lot of progress in Flint with respect to Medicaid waiver program that I think was an excellent program. We've replaced fixtures in the schools, again, we're continuing to provide emergency supplies, we've improved nutrition opportunities in terms of food bank, we've done things with early childhood education programs, we're working on economic development programs to bring more jobs to Flint and in Detroit there's been a solid proposal for a solution for some time and we're working through the legislative process. You just work hard on solving the issues and moving forward. 406 foreign direct investment projects were created in Michigan between January 2011 and August 2018, resulting in 51,596 jobs. Those projects generated a total capital investment of $12.7 billion. Additionally, Michigan saw a 24 percent increase in international travel spending from 2011-2017, with international travel spending in Michigan hitting $2.2 billion in 2017. In 2018, Michigan ranked third in the nation for number of investment projects from China. Michigan also ranked first in the Midwest for number of jobs created by Chinese investment. Since Snyder's first visit to China in 2011, Michigan received $1.21 billion in new investment from China, resulting in 6,304 jobs for Michigan residents. The release of the Army Corps of Engineers plan for Brandon Road Lock and Dam marks a critically important step forward in the fight to protect our Great Lakes from invasive carp. The plan lays out important steps that must be taken to stop the relentless advance of silver and bighead carp toward Lake Michigan. It is time for all the Great Lakes states and Canadian provinces -- and all who care about the lakes -- to come together to demand action at Brandon Road Lock and Dam, a critical pinch point for stopping invasive carp. These harmful invaders are advancing toward the Great Lakes at an alarming rate and we cannot wait any longer to take immediate, decisive action. Michigan is a welcoming state and we are proud of our rich history of immigration. But our first priority is protecting the safety of our residents. Given the terrible sit"

Some in this country argue that the solution is to -- is to deport every illegal immigrant and that any proposal short of this amounts to amnesty. I disagree. It is neither wise nor realistic to round up millions of people, many with deep roots in the United States, and send them across the border. There is a rational middle ground between granting an automatic path to citizenship for every illegal immigrant, and a program of mass deportation. That middle ground recognizes that there are differences between an illegal immigrant who crossed the border recently and someone who has worked here for many years, and has a home, a family, and an otherwise clean record. I believe that illegal immigrants who have roots in our country and want to stay should have to pay a meaningful penalty for breaking the law,... to pay their taxes,... to learn English... and to work in a job for a number of years. People who meet these conditions should be able to apply for citizenship but approval would not be automatic, and they will have to wait in line behind those who played by the rules and followed the law. What I've have just described is not amnesty it is a way for those who have broken the law to pay their debt to society, and demonstrate the character that makes a good citizen. For at the heart of compassionate conservatism is an appreciation for the indispensable contribution of the institutions of civil society to human flourishing and of the ways in which the well-being of society as a whole depends upon their ongoing vitality... Seeking to forge an alternative to both the night-watchman state of classical liberalism and the welfare state of egalitarian liberalism, compassionate conservatism has sought to articulate an understanding of the state's role which neither ignores or absorbs the institutions of civil society, but instead looks with favor on them, respects their structure and rightful autonomy, and assists them in the fulfillment of their responsibilities. The promise of compassionate conservatism, in short, consists in its capacity to move our thinking beyond the narrow world of the individual-state-market grid, to project on to the American public scene the insights and concerns of the pluralist tradition. By doing so, it can help lay the groundwork for the type of authentically pluralist public philosophy we so badly need. My fellow Americans, this day has brought terrible news and great sadness to our country. At 9:00 a.m. this morning, Mission Control in Houston lost contact with our Space Shuttle Columbia. A short time later, debris was seen falling from the skies above Texas. The Columbia is lost; there are no survivors. On board was a crew of seven: Colonel Rick Husband; Lt. Colonel Michael Anderson; Commander Laurel Clark; Captain David Brown; Commander William McCool; Dr. Kalpana Chawla; and Ilan Ramon, a Colonel in the Israeli Air Force. These men and women "
Q4496," I would spend a great deal of time taking my message to Hispanic Americans and to other minority groups in this country, African Americans, Asian Americans and describing why it is that conservative principles are best for them and for their families, that's something I wish I would have spent a lot more time doing... We would have taken ad dollars as well and responded to some of the attacks that came our way, some of them by the way were below the belt... there were things that were said in some of the ads that came against us in Hispanic media but also in English media that were not accurate and we should have fought back harder against those things, and shut them down and made it loud and clear that those things were wrong.... but I will be talking with our nominee about the mistakes I made and suggesting things that he or she ought do differently than I did.... but the real thing that I wish I had done differently is make a greater effort at communicating to minority voters in this country the policies that I think are right to help minority families and that's without question the biggest mistake I made in the campaign. Ann and I have heavy hearts tonight as we have learned that our friend, Senator Bob Bennett, has passed away. For many years, Bob has been a friend and a counselor. When I ran for public office, he spent hours with me, offering advice and sharing his experience. When I moved to Utah to take responsibility for the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, he helped me navigate the government agencies and U.S. Senate committees to secure essential resources that would make the Games successful. His keen mind made him a leading figure in the Senate on issues as disparate and far-reaching as emerging technologies and federal budgets. He was respected by men and women on both sides of the aisle, not only for his expertise but also for his common touch, his common sense, and his commitment to uncommon virtues. What I will remember most about Senator Bennett is his unwavering commitment to principle; his is an example of integrity and character that will long live in the memories of all of us who knew him. God be with you, Bob, till we meet again at Jesus' feet. Romney's moralistic sense of responsibility couldn't be more different from Trump's self-styled playboy lifestyle.... Trump, 70, and the 69-year-old Romney have far more in common than many realize: Both came to prominence as risk takers and dealmakers, and both have spent much of their lives seeking to emulate and outdo the success of their famous fathers. `I would describe a potential relationship as complementary,' said Marc Wolpow, who worked with Romney at Bain Capital... Romney, he said, failed to connect with blue-collar voters... but he possesses the diplomatic skills to be secretary of state. Trump hit it off with many average voters... but his brusque manner could be problematic in handling world affairs. `I think if you would merge both of them you'd have the perfect president... Mitt could be the good cop to the bad cops that surround Trump,' [ he said ]. Romney, meanwhile, sees the possible job not just as a way to fulfill his desire to serve, but also to salve deep wounds [ from two successive campaign losses ]. Now, I'm far from the first to conclude that Donald Trump lacks the temperament to be president. After all, this is an individual who mocked a disabled reporter, who bragged about his marital affairs, and who laces his public speeches with vulgarity. Donald Trump says he admires Vladimir Putin, at the same time he has called George W. Bush a liar. That is a twisted example of evil trumping good. Mr. Trump is directing our anger for less than noble purposes. He creates scapegoats of Muslims and Mexican immigrants. He calls for the use of torture. He calls for killing the innocent children and family members of terrorists. He cheers assaults on protesters. He applauds the prospect of twisting the Constitution to limit First Amendment freedom... This is the very brand of anger that has led other nations into the abyss. Here's what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. I believe that a border security program should include, as well, a barrier on our southern border. When the vote for the president's proposal failed, we went to see the second alternative, I voted for that as well, again, because I want to see government get opened and government workers get paid.... That proposal also failed. And now it's going to be up to Republican leadership and Democrat leadership to come together and begin to negotiate. Democrats have said they're not willing to negotiate unless the government's open. Well, they tried their effort. I voted for it. It didn't happen. Now they've got to negotiate. We've got to have the leaders of both parties, including the Democrat Party, sit down with the president and work out a deal that deals with border security and gets this government o"
Q6409269," I hereby order that effective Noon today, March 17, 2020, and continuing until 11:59 p.m. on March 31, 2020: A. Restaurants and Bars: All Restaurants and Bars are hereby closed to the general public except that to the extent permitted by applicable law, and in accordance with any recommendations of the Iowa Department of Public Health, food and beverages may be sold if such food or beverages are promptly taken from the premises, such as on a carry-out or drive-through basis, or if the food or beverage is delivered to customers off the premises. B. Fitness Center: All fitness centers, health clubs, health spas, gyms, aquatic centers are hereby closed. C. Theaters: All theaters or other performance venues at which live performances or or motion pictures are shown are hereby closed. D. Casinos and Gaming Facilities: All casinos and other facilities conducting pari-mutuel wagering or gaming operations are hereby closed. E. Mass Gathering: Social, community, spiritual, religious, recreational, leisure, and sporting gatherings and events of more than 10 people are hereby prohibited at all locations and venues, including but not limited to parades, festivals, conventions, and fundraisers. Planned large gatherings and events must be canceled or postponed until after termination of this disaster. F. Senior Citizen Centers and Adult Daycare Facilities: All facilities that conduct adult day services or other senior citizen centers are hereby closed. Well, first of all, let's just start from the beginning. The number one priority in all of this was to maintain the confidentiality that the victims had asked and requested me to do. So that was what we based everything that we did... to maintain the confidentiality that they asked from us. And it's a small office, so you know, we had to be very careful and we were limited to what we could do that wouldn't potentially, you know, erode that confidentiality and that trust that they had placed in me. If you read the letter that was submitted to me, you know there were people that had maybe witnessed that. But I think there was also some fear of retaliation in that too. And so my message to anyone that works in state government -- and it has been since I took office -- is that I have a zero-tolerance policy. I want them to know if they see or experience any type of sexual harassment or if they're a victim, there's a process in place. They have somebody to go to to report it. They will be heard and, if necessary, action will be taken. And that's what's important, I believe, for state employees to know that. This was an extremely difficult decision, however it is the right one for the pro-life movement and the state of Iowa. When I signed the Fetal Heartbeat bill last May, we knew that it would be an uphill fight in the courts that might take us all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. But everything changed last June, when the Iowa Supreme Court struck down our 72-hour waiting period after concluding that the Iowa Constitution provides a right to an abortion and imposes strict scrutiny on all our abortion laws. I think the Iowa Supreme Court got it wrong. But after this decision and because of Planned Parenthood's legal maneuverings, I see no path to successfully appeal the district court's decision or to get this lawsuit before the U.S. Supreme Court. Rather than be distracted by a losing legal battle, now is the time to renew our focus on changing hearts and minds and to seek other ways to advance the cause of protecting the unborn in Iowa and around the nation. I'm proud to lead the most pro-life state in the country and remain firm in my belief that all human life is precious. At that point they still had asked me to keep this confidential. As I said, it was a very small office, so none of the details were released. And that means the victims. I can't change the culture in state government if I don't honor confidentiality. If you listen to what the victims of sexual harassment say, or individuals, I can't put additional barriers in front of them that prevent them from coming forward. I want them to know that we have a process. They have somebody to report to. If you don't feel confident in reporting to your direct report, your supervisor, your director, there's an alternative person that you can report to, the Department of Administrative Services -- or they can directly report to my office. And, you know, I was glad that they felt like they could come to my office and report this. So, that needs to be clear, that there is a process. There are different avenues to report what you see or if you're a victim. And that they'll be heard. And there will be action taken. You know, how many times have you heard me say that, you know, we'll continue to look at any situation. And if we can improve it, then fine. But you just -- I can't, you can't dictate behavior. You can't dictate treating people with respect. But you can lead. And you can lead by example, and you can say, this is wh"
Q4962244," Big Money Dominating Politics. Citizens United (2010) and other recent Supreme Court cases allowing the super-rich to saturate the airwaves with advertising for the candidate they back, with full knowledge that they thereby ingratiate themselves with the candidate and can expect to call in favors all this has made money king in the American electoral system. It isn't that most Congressmen are personally bribed. It is their campaigns that receive the money. But a big war chest is job security for congressmen and senators. Richard L. Hasen explains that `Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the Supreme Court in 2010 in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission,' rejected the idea that it is corruption for large donors to the campaign of a politician is corruption. Rather, the donor receives only `Ingratiation and access' which is permissible. In a case decided in 2014, McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, Chief Justice John Roberts went even further, celebrating the idea of politicians responding to the wishes of big donors and spenders. Not only are `ingratiation and access' afforded those making large campaign contributions not corruption, Roberts explained. Donors 'em body a central feature of democracy that constituents support candidates who share their beliefs and interests, and candidates who are elected can be expected to be responsive to those concerns.' In a democracy, Roberts tells us, we should want politicians to be responsive to big donors. Citizens United was... a fragile 5-4 decision that could have been weakened or ultimately overturned. Now, it is 6-3 and likely become set in stone to the vast detriment of our democracy.

Q3601035," I am incredibly proud of the NASA, Boeing, and United Launch Alliance teams and their ongoing work in a dynamic situation to ensure the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft is safe on its Orbital Flight Test. The teams continue their work to meet as many mission objectives as possible and return safely to Earth. We continue to gather critical data that will help us ensure safety and reliability for future human space flight missions. Early this morning, NASA and Boeing successfully launched Starliner on the first human-rated United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 in Florida. The plan was for Starliner to rendezvous and dock with the International Space Station and return home safely to Earth. While a lot of things went right, the uncrewed spacecraft did not reach the planned orbit and will not dock to the International Space Station. This is in fact why we test. Teams worked quickly to ensure the spacecraft was in a stable orbit and preserved enough fuel to ensure a landing opportunity. Boeing, in coordination with NASA, is working to return Starliner to White Sands, New Mexico, Sunday. At NASA we do really difficult things, and we do them all the time. I spoke to Vice President Pence, Chairman of the National Space Council, and he remains very optimistic in our ability to safely launch American astronauts from American soil. We remain positive even though we did face challenges today. We'll be getting a lot more data in the coming days. One of the biggest successes today was watching NASA, Boeing, ULA teams work to make the right decisions for our astronauts and country. We will continue to share information. It's in the interest of the nation. We'll share data as soon as possible. NASA strongly supports the White House's continued bold direction in forging a sustainable and focused space policy that strengthens American leadership. It was my honor today to represent the agency at the National Space Council, where the President announced Space Policy Directive-3 -- which will guide critical and much-needed progress for space traffic management. SPD-3 builds on our continued progress implementing SPD-1, which is galvanizing American space leadership by returning to the Moon with commercial and international partners, and SPD-2, which will create regulatory certainty for entrepreneurs to raise capital to grow the American economy in space. As we continue to thrive in space, we also have more people launching to orbit, and an increasingly complex universe of satellites overhead. SPD-3 provides guidelines and initiatives to ensure that America is a leader in providing a safe and secure environment as space traffic increases. Common sense space situational awareness and traffic management will be good for our economy and will help provide a more stable environment for the burgeoning space economy. Reducing the growing threat of orbital debris is in the interest of all nations, and NASA looks forward to working with the National Space Council, the Department of Commerce and other partners on a path forward. SPD-3 and the directives that preceded it, along with the President's enthusiasm for our nation's innovative work, are providing a strong foundation for our nation to once again do the big things that will shape a bright future for all of us in space. This means he wants NASA to rely on several providers of aerospace excellence and reliability. This may eventually include the space projects of Alphabet (- Free Report) founder Larry Page. The NASA and SpaceX partnership is a great early example of what's possible when private enterprise (and wealth) takes the initiative in space science and engineering and gets full cooperation from government agencies. This will only encourage more space entrepreneurs to build their visions. And in a time of rising global mistrust between nations, the International Space Station and its 15 member countries stands as a symbol of unity that only science and shared knowledge can create.

Q16192221," Would you like to come work in the field with us? � Maher mockingly replied. � Work in the fields? Senator, I am a house n � a. � Nowadays it � s often difficult to discern in some instances if the n-word is being used as an epithet or a term of endearment. And, the confusion illustrates what happens when an epithet like the n-word, once hurled at African-Americans in this country and banned from polite conversation, now has a broad-based cultural acceptance in our society. For example, two renowned African-American academics embrace the use of the n-word. While many of Maher � s guests rescinded their appearances on the show last week, Georgetown Professor Michael Eric Dyson pinched-hit for him. � I � m emotional about this. I love Bill Maher. He � s a very dear friend. But as I � ve made plain through the years, the n-word should be reserved for black use. Period, � Dyson wrote on Twitter. In 2002 Harvard Law Professor Randall Kennedy, who wrote � Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word, � said that while the word has been used to � terrorize and humiliate � black Americans, � it � s also been used as a term of endearment and a gesture of solidarity. � However, the notion that it is acceptable for African-Americans to use the n-word with each other yet it is considered racist for others outside the race to use it unquestionably sets up a double standard. And because language is a public enterprise, the notion that one ethnic group has property rights to the term is an absurdly narrow argument. Moreover, the fact that African-Americans have appropriated the n-word does not negate our long history of self-hatred. Shortly after Maher dropped the word, many on Twitter chimed in defending him, stating he used a modified n-word, meaning it ended in an � a � rather than a � r. � Many today argue the meaning of the n-word is all in how one spells it. By dropping the � er � ending and replacing it with either an � a � or � ah, You don't get America. You said: `You do not have some human right, some abstract thing given to you by God or something like that.' Actually, that's exactly what America declares we do have: People are the image-bearers of God, created with dignity and inalienable rights. Sadly, you don't understand human dignity. A person's skin, ancestry, and bank balance have nothing to do with their intrinsic value. This declaration of universal dignity is what America is about. Madison called our Constitution `the greatest reflection on human nature.' You talk about culture but don't know squat about western heritage -- which sees people not as tribes but as individuals of limitless worth. The celebration of universal dignity IS our culture, and it rejects your `white culture' crybaby politics. It rejects all identity politics. Sometime after moving back into your parents' basement, you knock-off Nazis fell in love with reheated 20th century will-to-power garbage. Your `ideas' aren't just hateful, un-American poison -- they're also just so dang boring. The future doesn't belong to your stupid memes. You don't get America.

Well, when you have the day job I have, it's like every 12 minutes, if you're away from Twitter, it can always be like this kind of a moment because you don't really know what's just happened. But, I mean, big picture, there's a lot we don't know, but I think three things are relevant immediately. The first is sources and methods are the lifeblood of our intelligence community, and we need spies because the world is a broken place and we need people to protect America's interests around the world. And so we need to, as a people, well before you're a Republican or Democrat, care about sources and methods.

Q295492," here at home we've got to restore the American Dream for our children and grandchildren. It's not about government spending or redistribution like President Obama believes. It's about opportunity and growth. We need to repeal and replace Obamacare, ot a little bit of it, all of it. Some of these Republicans now want Obamacare Lite with some tax increases, some entitlement program. No, we need to get rid of the whole thing and replace it. Third, overseas we've got to defeat ISIS, not contain them, not degrade them. These are radical Islamic terrorists. We need to hunt them down and kill them... unlike the president, unlike the politically correct crowd, you and I are wiling to speak the truth, we need a leader who will speak the truth... you identify the enemy. Secondly, you take the political handcuffs off our military, so this authorization in Congress, take out the three year time limit, take out the ban on ground troops. Let's stop being politically correct, let's stop listening to the political left. Let's go to the military and say `we don't want to degrade them, contain them, expel we want to kill them.' We've got a State Department official saying we need a jobs program and we need better governments. They don't need jobs, they need to be killed. I don't think he's a conservative at heart. He has been for big government. He's been for, for example, a government takeover of healthcare, then he's been against it. The reality is is that, I don't think he's opposed to big government. I think he just wants to be the one running big government. I do think he'll be better than Hillary Clinton. I don't think it's a great set of choices. I think there's 0% chance that Hillary Clinton would put a conservative on the Supreme Court. I'm not here telling you it'll be 100% Donald Trump would, but at least there's a chance. And so, look, I think that a lot of the criticisms that Marco Rubio made, that Ted Cruz and others made, that I've made about Donald Trump are true, but I also think he has done a good job understanding that voters, they haven't seen their incomes go up. They're worried about illegal immigration. They're worried about America's standing on the world stage. They've been left behind by the elites in DC. They're mad at President Obama's policies, but they're also mad at the Republican leadership's policies. He's done a good job of understanding that. We conservatives have to do a better job explaining why our principles will help Americans join the middle class. Five years ago today, eleven honorable men were taken from us far too soon in the tragic Deepwater Horizon explosion off of our coast. This year, as we reflect upon each individual who lost their lives that fateful day, our hearts and prayers go out to the families and friends of these men. They worked tirelessly for countless hours on the rig to provide for their families, and their work helped drive an industry that supports thousands more families across our state. Although they are no longer with us, they will forever be in our memory. The images of oil-drenched wildlife and marshes have been seared into our memories, but our spirit and perseverance are stronger than ever before. As we look back over these past five years, we have seen our coast continue to rebound from the oil-battered wetlands and beaches we saw in the months after the spill. Although we will not know the full extent of the damage until a final assessment is completed, response and recovery efforts are ongoing, and scientists say our habitats and ecosystems are slowly coming back. However, there is more work to do as oil continues to wash ashore here in our state - and we won't stop working until our coast and wetlands are fully restored. It is shameful that Gov. Jindal has decided that abusing his executive power to accomplish the goals of House Bill 707, even after it was tabled indefinitely by our legislature today, is worth more effort than fixing our disastrous state budget. In his time in Iowa, he may have forgotten what everyday Louisianians value, but the testimony today against HB 707 should have reminded him. Discrimination is not a Louisiana value. The bill, and Jindal's executive order if it does accomplish the same goals, would hurt our state's economy. There is no question about that. IBM, Dow Chemicals, EA Sports, Marriott, the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau and Greater New Orleans, Inc. have all voiced their strong concerns about the adverse economic impact HB 707 would have. An executive order aiming to do the same thing would be no different. Gov. Jindal is clearly trying to leave the biggest mess possible, as he readies himself to spend even less time in Louisiana and to launch his presidential campaign. In the end, his extreme ideology is only making the state a worse place for those of us who actually plan to live here past his last day in office. President Obama and Hillary Clinton, they've said nuanced and different things about vac"
Q1357640," I mean, the last few days, if you read some of the allegations out there about Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and her flip-flopping on marijuana laws, and willing to change her vote and talking obviously about the fact that she was preparing to allege that the President and others were anti-woman and anti-Semitic if they wanted to get rid of her as chairwoman of the DNC. You know, where are the Democrats on TV being asked do you agree with this? I mean, do you support what Debbie Wasserman Schultz is doing? Or the opposite, maybe Debbie Wasserman Schultz is right. Do you support the President and his quest to get rid of a female chairwoman of the DNC? You never hear the questions like that played on the other side. And even people like Mark Halperin and today, Chris Cillizza came out with an article saying the RNC has a point. And if anything, this little circus last weekend, where this Beltway media is actually tweeting to each other, and if you follow this, and I hope you don't, but if you follow a lot of these Beltway journalists, they talk to each other all day and all night long about these types of debates. And it's always the same thing. And so look, this idea that a third party is going to be able to tell what another party has in their heart is not just a ridiculous sort of exercise, but is a total waste of time. And it is completely irrelevant to the truth. It was captured through a lot of issues. It was captured through talking about education, it was captured through talked about our position on the world stage, it was captured talking about what we need to do to repeal and replace Obamacare, but beside that it was captured in a moment of pride looking at a widow up in the balcony that lost a hero soldier and honored by a president that understood the incredible value of life and the value and respect that he has for the heroes of this country and also the respect for the United States of America at that moment where the president, the House and the Senate are getting together and talking about how great America ought to be all coming together in a stew of pride that was captured by looking at that great family up in the balcony. That's what I was thinking about when that happened and I think that's what a lot of people were thinking about. Since Trump won the election, and especially since he has been in office, nearly every economic indicator has been on the upswing -- from the stock market to employment numbers to business development and more -- something Priebus attributes to an overall message of optimism emanating from the president. Priebus's words: I think what's important to know is that underlying all of the things that President Trump is doing is one real basic theme which is optimism, First of all, if you look at the promises he made on immigration, you have border crossings down by 70%. You look at TPP, one of the first executive orders the President signed was getting out of TPP. You look at ethics, that was one of the bullet points. You had every employee of the West Wing signed an ethics pledge that said you're not going to lobby for five years after you leave this place, and you're never going to lobby for a foreign country. Look at Neil Gorsuch, first 100 days a Supreme Court justice is sworn in, first time since 1881. And if you just give me one minute, I won't drone on. But, this idea about major legislation not being passed within the first 100 days, Barack Obama had a prebaked stimulus package that started in October... passed in February, it was pre-baked. George Bush didn't get any major legislation until June. Clinton, August 10th. Bush 41, a year and a half later. Reagan, August 13th. Carter, 658 days after he took the office. Nixon, one year. Johnson, 225 days. Here is the deal, the President signed over 28 bills already. Health care may happen next week; it may not. We're hopeful it will. As far as border security, you said the military. We have right now in the CR negotiating one of the biggest increases in military spending in decades. So, he is fulfilling his promises and doing it at breakneck speed. Here's what I think people should understand: One of the pillars of Reaganomics was deregulation. If you ask anyone about Reaganomics, you can't have a conversation about how that economic transformation happened without talking about deregulation. If you look at the president's earliest actions, it's all about deregulation. It's all about CRAs. It's about deregulation. I think he's at 12 CRAs now, and there's only one that was done previous to President Trump. So when you take the executive order on deregulation two for one, you take the CRA activity, you look at what he's doing on clean power -- and obviously that's part of it -- but this unbelievable effort and focus on deregulation is part of what his vision is. The president will tell you -- and you saw in his tax plan, he's all for lowering taxes for every American and it's going to be the biggest tax cut for all Ame"
Q13475242," What we have to do a better job of is educating not only Iowans, but the American people that they can be self-sufficient. They don't have to rely on the government to be the do-all, end-all for everything they need and desire, and that's what we have fostered, is really a generation of people that rely on the government to provide absolutely everything for them. It's going to take a lot of education to get people out of that. It's going to be very painful and we know that. So do we have the intestinal fortitude to do that?... We're looking at Obamacare right now. Once we start with those benefits in January, how are we going to get people off of those? It's exponentially harder to remove people once they've already been on those programs... we rely on government for absolutely everything. And in the years since I was a small girl up until now into my adulthood with children of my own, we have lost a reliance on not only our own families, but so much of what our churches and private organizations used to do. They used to have wonderful food pantries. They used to provide clothing for those that really needed it. But we have gotten away from that. Now we're at a point where the government will just give away anything. Bottom line though is Russia is not our friend. I can't speak for the president. I can't speak for his campaign, but what I can state is they are not our friend. I think the president has surrounded himself now with some very high level officals, especially when you look at the Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. What a great man to be leading our services. We have a wonderful joint chiefs of staff. We have others, great people put in positions of authority to advise the president. and I think they all very clearly have stated what I have stated as well, that Russia is not our friend. I feel very confident about those advisers that are now surrounding the president and we know that the investigations will continue. I'm not on the Intelligence Committee so I can't speak to all of the testimony that has been given. But, certainly, I will always maintain my stance that Russia is not our friend. They're someone that we need to keep an eye on and we need to develop a greater strategy on how we respond to any threats coming from Russia. I join the nation today in honoring our nation's 41st president, George H.W. Bush. He was a beloved husband, father and grandfather, a veteran and a true American leader. Like our forefathers who came before him, George H.W. Bush was committed to furthering the ideals that this country was built upon, in a way that will transcend his life. He showed us that relationships matter, people matter, freedom matters. When I was deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom, all Kuwaitis, especially the police force, were so appreciative of Americans and viewed George H.W. Bush as their savior. His commitment to sharing the American value of freedom and democracy with the Kuwaiti people helped secure America's partnerships with the region ever since. We owe so much of our nation's enduring peace, security and prosperity to George H.W. Bush, and, I personally am ever grateful for his leadership and service to our country. My heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with the entire Bush family during this time. There's no doubt that this is an exciting start to the new year for the great state of Iowa -- from the phase one China trade agreement being finalized to the USMCA moving through the Senate, I'm proud to work with President Trump to deliver real results for Iowa's farmers and manufacturers. I was honored to join the President, Senator Chuck Grassley, and Governor Kim Reynolds at the White House for today's signing ceremony. As Iowa's 4th largest trading partner, China is a critically important market for Iowans, and this phase one deal -- which is especially promising for our ag and manufacturing sectors -- will help provide certainty for folks back home and starts to address other long-time issues with China: forced technology transfers and non-tariff trade barriers. As always, it's imperative we keep the pressure on China to uphold their end of the bargain to ensure Iowa's farmers and businesses see the full impact of this trade agreement. Our loophole-ridden and outdated tax code is a prime example of how government inefficiency can negatively impact Iowans and their businesses. At 35 percent, our corporate tax rate is the highest in the developed world. For our small businesses -- which make up 97 percent of all employers in Iowa -- the marginal tax rate can reach as high as 44.6 percent. On top of that, business owners spend untold amounts of money and hours attempting to comply with our nonsensical tax code. We must ensure that this mission to reform our broken tax code focuses on relieving the burden the complicated federal tax system has placed on Iowa's families, individuals, and small businesses. Such reform is essential to reinvigorating America's economy. I am pleased to see"
Q11702," At the outset of these talks, the Obama administration said it would secure an agreement that affirmed Iran does not have a right to enrich and permanently dismantles the infrastructure of its nuclear programs. It said that sanctions would not be lifted until Iran met concrete, verifiable standards. And if these terms were not met, the president promised he would walk away. The American people and our allies were counting on President Obama to keep his word. Instead, the President has abandoned his own goals. His `deal' will hand Iran billions in sanctions relief while giving it time and space to reach a break-out threshold to produce a nuclear bomb-all without cheating. Instead of making the world less dangerous, this `deal' will only embolden Iran - the world's largest sponsor of terror-by helping stabilize and legitimize its regime as it spreads even more violence and instability in the region. Instead of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, this deal is likely to fuel a nuclear arms race around the world. Scalia agreed to meet me and Barry Jackson, my chief of staff, for a clandestine lunch discussion at one of Scalia's favorite establishments, Washington, D.C.'s A.V. Ristorante (now, sadly, closed). It was there that Jackson and I made our pitch, over a pepperoni and anchovies pizza. Scalia's reaction was a mixture of amusement and humility, tempered by an underlying seriousness of purpose that reflected his love of country and sense of obligation to it. He asked very direct questions on both the practicality of running -- including how a candidacy would impact his role on the Court, what Dole's reaction would be if he were to express willingness and, ironically, what the impact on the political process might be of a vacancy appearing on the Court in the months before a presidential election. By Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner had had it with questions from Democrats - and reporters-about congressional funding for Amtrak and Tuesday's deadly derailment of a Northeast Corridor passenger train in Philadelphia. `Are you really going to ask that? That's a stupid question,' Boehner told a reporter.... Boehner, R-Ohio, said that the derailment wasn't about money because the train with 238 passengers and five crew members aboard was traveling through a section of Northeast Philadelphia at over 100 miles per hour, double the regulated speed for that section of track.... The House of Representatives' Appropriations Committee voted Wednesday to cut Amtrak's annual subsidy from $1.4 billion to $1.1 billion. President Obama and Eric Holder failed to transform America into a socialist utopia when they were in office, but they've clearly not given up just yet. They've recruited liberal billionaires, labor unions, and left-wing activist groups to join them in a coordinated program to rig our nation's legislative boundaries in favor of Democrats. We have to stop them because the outcomes of these elections will have an ever-lasting impact on the future of our country. I served in the state legislature and understand the support our down-ballot candidates need. The RSLC has delivered resounding victories for our Party for two decades, and I stand with them as they fight to protect our majorities across the country. I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more... Recent related news John Boehner thinks Ted Cruz is a real devil.

Huffington PostRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump once again took aim at Ted Cruz and John Kasich for joining forces to try and stop him from winning the party's... FOXNews.com PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) Let me thank all my colleagues who have worked to put this bill together. Today I rise - and the House rises - to support and defend our Constitution. We do not take this action lightly, but simply there is no alternative. This is not a dispute between the parties, or even between the branches of our government. This executive overreach is an affront to the rule of law and to the Constitution itself. I appreciate all the efforts of those working to fix our broken immigration system, especially since I'm one of them. But what we are dealing with is a president who has ignored the people, has ignored the Constitution, and even his own past statements. On Iran, given everything I've seen so far, it's a bad deal. Paves the way for a nuclear Iran and yesterday, the President admitted that it will likely further Iran's support for terror activities throughout the region. It blows my mind that the administration would agree to lift the arms and missile bans, and sanctions on a general who supplied militants with weapon"
Q173839," Stop lights and busy intersections are common grounds for homeless people to seek opportunity. For many of us, we roll up in our vehicle or bike and wonder: who are they and how did they get there? How did they get to this point in their life? In northwest Arvada there is a similar scenario.... actually, it's very different. There is a homeless man who I've seen playing tennis, dancing, enjoying the skate park and at times soaking up the sun. He goes about his day in his own world. He walks his bike with a kid trailer loaded with his belongings around the town in all kinds of weather-year round. I started by saying hello to him and got nothing back. No eye contact and no acknowledgment. I decided it might be best to ask around. Last year around Christmas, I asked the right person who he was. Tom Spear was the answer. Foosball Champion. World Champion. Homeless. If you saw him in your town, you would be intrigued. The first episode of SPEAR introduces you to some of his friends and people he's come in contact with throughout the years. Producer, editor and photographer Cody Broadway and I take you on a journey of a man that is best described by those that knew him as... methodical, I don't think we know that. usually health and human services tries to get these things wrapped up as quickly as possible. The reason being that having children on a military facility is neither or minors in this case is neither a good thing to do and frankly it's extraordinarily expensive. It's much more expensive to maintain a child on a military facility. The Department of Defense charges a pretty high rate of reimbursement there. I think that's appropriate because they always want to discourage the use of these facilities. They're not designed for this purpose. I've never met a base commander that likes people coming on or off of his facility that he's got to background checks on and they're worried about people who are not there on business that are there for some other purpose than training or what the base is designed to do. So again, I have no doubt it will be brought to an end as quickly as possible. it certainly was last time, but it's hard to know how long they'll need to do this, Look, I think he has certainly been supportive in terms of defensive weapons and those kinds of things. But no, I think you look at the Iranian agreement, I think that was very reckless and I think it endangered Israel. You know, he's let it out personally when microphones caught him that he certainly didn't like President Netanyahu. He kept him waiting one time famously in the White House while the president and his family had dinner. He didn't invite the prime minister to join them. So no, I think its been series of calculated insults and I think this was the last insult on the way out the door. I don't think it makes the president look very well. And certainly to do something that you know deliberately at odds with what the incoming president is going to do on a stage this big shows a certain pettiness that I'm surprised to see in President Obama who usually rises above these sorts of things. Even though time has passed, the nightmare that took place 20 years ago vividly remains for many and our sorrow still lingers for those lost in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. When I think back on that fateful day, I remember the heartbreak, pain and shock felt by all-but most especially by the families, friends and loved ones of those whose lives were prematurely and unfairly taken. In the midst of a terrible tragedy, I remember the bravery and strength displayed by first responders. I will also never forget the outpouring of love and support within our own communities and from countless others across the nation and around the world. And I shall always be grateful for the splendid leadership by Governor Frank Keating, First Lady Cathy Keating, Oklahoma City Mayor Ron Norick and Rep. Frank Lucas in that time of tragedy and triumph for the state of Oklahoma. This is something where Congress has collectively avoided taking responsibility for years. The Constitution is awfully clear... about where war making authority resides -- it resides in this body. And we've had leadership, honestly on both sides, that have put off this debate again and again and again. As a matter of fact, when the Secretary appeared before our subcommittee I asked him, `Would it help you to have a new authorization?' ... and he said `Yes it would, it's something that would help us a lot.' So if we're going to send people to war, we owe them the support of the Congress of the United States... We're at war against an enemy that did not exist in a place that we did not expect to fight, so how an AUMF that was passed 16 years ago... could possibly be stretched to cover this is just beyond belief to me. Gin has always been the centre of attention, however this summer the lesser known counterpart to the infamous serve, the Tonic, is set to flourish and we are excited to be at the foref"
Q45940," I know they got the house boarded up and holes covered, so we got a little reprieve. But when they start ripping open those walls or doing the plumbing, we are just in fear of the next wave of attack. NYPD officer, fiancee charged with murder in death of 8-year-old son, kept in freezing garage A man and his fiancee have been charged with murder in the death of his 8-year-old son, who was left overnight in an unheated garage in freezing temperatures, officials said. Michael Valva, an New York Police Department transit officer, and Angela Pollina left Thomas Valva in the garage overnight when temperatures dipped to 19 degrees. The boy was found dead the next day, his body temperature was 76 degrees. `The medical examiner has ruled it a homicide with a major contributing factor of hypothermia,' Suffolk County Police Chief Geraldine Hart told WNBC. `We believe certainly that Thomas was kept in the garage overnight preceding his death.' Police were called to the home Jan. 17 after neighbors saw a boy had fallen in the driveway and lost consciousness, WNBC reported. Valva told investigators his son fell while waiting for the bus then lost consciousness, The New York Times reported. Officers arrived and found Michael Valva performing life-saving techniques on the boy in the family's basement. The boy was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead. The family had a home security system and kept close watch on their six children. Valva's three sons ages, 6, 8 and 10, and Pollina's three daughters ages, a 6-year-old and twin 11-year-olds, WNBC reported. Footage showed Valva routinely withheld food as a punishment and exposed his sons to cold temperatures, investigators said. `We are still investigating the extent of the abuse and if it extended to all of the children,' Hart told WNBC. Michael Valva and Pollina were arrested and charged with second-degree murder, officials said. Valva, who joined the NYPD in 2005, was suspended, the Times reported. The attorney for Valva and Pollini maintain their innocence, WNBC reported. The couple will be arraigned Saturday. Shortly after his son's death, Valva raised $16,000 on a GoFundMe account to pay for the boy's funeral, News 12 Long Island reported. The boy's mother, Justyna Valva, lost custody of the boys, the Times reported. She had not seen Thomas in two years until looking at his body in the medical examiner's office.' I just really want justice for my son, As many of you know, a last ditch effort to repeal and replace Obamacare in the Senate failed by a vote of 49-51 very early this morning. I'm deeply disappointed that the Senate was unable to get the job done and improve healthcare for millions of people. Healthcare insurance premiums have increased 76 percent on average for Oklahoma residents on the federal exchange this year. For years, I and my staff have worked to develop solutions to our national healthcare crisis. After months of work and debate, we were one vote short. Today, some media pundits have focused on who won and who lost over the healthcare vote. This reaction is frustrating to me. This debate is not about what politician won and who lost or what political party won and which party lost, this healthcare conversation is about people's lives. First, we must realize that many Americans have been helped by Obamacare, but also admit that many Americans have been hurt by the law. This issue is complicated and is not as easy as some make it seem. Second, the missing part of today's reaction has been the families that can no longer afford health insurance because their rates have increased over 200%, both in states that expanded Medicaid and states that did not... The doctors who have taken early retirement rather than live their lives filling out new forms and taking lower reimbursement rates... The more than 6 million people who pay a healthcare tax penalty because they cannot afford coverage, or simply don't want to be forced by the government to purchase something... The hundreds of counties in America where there is one or no insurance carrier left. None of those realities changed last night, and none of those things occurred because of a Republican plan -- they were already spiraling out-of-control because of the Affordable Care Act. For every good thing that Obamacare did for those in poverty, it also created some adverse consequences for other Americans. In D.C., healthcare became a hyper partisan fight, instead of a mission to work together to get healthcare for people at rates they can afford. The losers in the failed vote last night were not politicians in Washington DC, they were people sitting at kitchen tables across America trying to make sense of the chaos of their finances and their government. A very sad sign of the times. There has never been a supreme court justice that has been filibustered. There has been a lot of noise on a lot of issues in nominations, but if you go back to Clarence Thomas, a very contentious supreme court nomination, he"
Q1822266," No one familiar with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals should be surprised at today's ruling. The 9th Circuit has a well-earned reputation for being presumptively reversible. Unlike the district court order, there is at least a court opinion which can be evaluated. Of particular interest is the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' suggestion that even those unlawfully present in the country have certain due process rights with respect to immigration. The Court cites Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 695 (2001) for the proposition that even aliens who have committed and been convicted of certain crimes while in the U.S. unlawfully may have due process rights with respect to travel to or from the United States. In addition, the Court ventures curiously into its own role in reviewing a President's national security conclusions. Legal permanent residents, non-citizens with current valid visas, non-citizens with expired visas (which were once valid), aliens with no legal standing, aliens who have committed a crime but have not yet been deported and aliens who are not even present in the United States but seek to come are just a few of the categories the Supreme Court will need to determine what process is due, if any. It seems clear to most of us-not on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals - there is no right to come to this country for non-citizens of the United States. It also seems clear judges are neither in a position, practically or jurisprudentially, to second guess national security determinations made by the Commander in Chief. There is a reason we elect the Commander in Chief and do not elect federal judges. For those, like Alexander Hamilton, who once or now wondered if the Judicial Branch would be too weak. Wonder no more. We got a production of documents from the State Department in August 2014, and we noticed in that production there were, I want to say, eight emails and they all had a private account and obviously we took note of that, but lots of people use both their work account and their private account, so we made note of it and we were interested in it. But we were mainly interested in the rest of the documents. So we spent September and October and November talking to the State Department, not just about her documents, but a whole litany, access to witnesses, there are lots of issues in Benghazi. And so they never once told us-hey look, we don't really have her emails; we are going to have to get them back from her. And what we learned, they sent a letter to her and the other secretaries of state in October and there was a production made to the State Department. So fast forward to February, and oh by the way in December we wrote her personal attorney, David Kendall, and said look can you help us with this private email address, and he referred us to the State Department, so we are thinking the whole time the State Department has all these emails, we just have to hurry them up. They gave us another production in February that was about 800 pages, but 300 emails, all of them were personal accounts, no official account. It was when the New York Times broke their story, is the first time I learned the only reason we are getting a personal account is because that's all she has, and oh by the way, she kept her records when she left the State Department. That was never was shared with us by the State Department, despite multiple opportunities to do so. After seeking and receiving a two week extension from the Committee, Secretary Clinton failed to provide a single new document to the subpoena issued by the Committee and refused to provide her private server to the Inspector General for the State Department or any other independent arbiter for analysis. We learned today, from her attorney, Secretary Clinton unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails from her personal server. While it is not clear precisely when Secretary Clinton decided to permanently delete all emails from her server, it appears she made the decision after October 28, 2014, when the Department of State for the first time asked the Secretary to return her public record to the Department. Gowdy continues: Not only was the Secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record, she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest. In light of the Secretary's unprecedented email arrangement with herself and her decision nearly two years after she left office to permanently delete all emails and because the equities at stake involve not only those of the Select Committee and Congress more broadly, but also those of the American people and their right to the full record of her tenure as secretary of State, we will work with the leadership of the House of Representatives as the Committee considers next steps. But it is clear Congress will need to speak with the former Secretary about her email arrangement and the decision to perman"
Q1857141," If anybody ever wondered why we're assigned security detail, I surely found out that day. Let me tell you, I want to specifically mention Crystal Griner and David Bailey. Crystal and David were assigned to my security detail that morning, and day in and day out they are part of our family. Jennifer and I truly treat them as part of our family because they are with us everywhere they go. On that day, June 14, they came in at 6:30 in the morning. We arrived at the baseball field just to play and practice for a game of charity baseball. Nobody would have suspected what ensued. Yet as soon as those shots were fired -- I'll tell you, when I was laying on the ground, one of the things I prayed for is that David and Crystal would be successful in carrying out their duties. And both David and Crystal are incredibly well trained, incredibly professional. But when I was laying there, not long after the first couple of shots were fired, I could hear a different caliber of weapon and that told me that they had immediately engaged the shooter. Let me tell you, if they didn't act so quickly, even after being shot both themselves and continued to engage the shooter and ultimately got him down, which not only saved my life, but saved the life of a lot of other people that are here in this chamber today. Crystal couldn't be with us today, but David Bailey is with us. David, you are my hero. You saved my life. Thank you so much. I also thank -- owe thanks to loot of people on the field with me. American families have already begun to see the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act -- greater take home pay, increased wages, bonuses, and better benefits. Even after all the positive success stories coming out about these tax cuts, some liberals continue to call for an increase in taxes and claim they would rather pay more in taxes themselves. Congressman LaMalfa and I today are introducing legislation that gives them the opportunity to put their money where their mouths are. In 2012, I introduced the Buffett Rule Act to address these tax hike advocates. If Warren Buffett and others like him truly feel they're not paying enough in taxes, we're giving them the opportunity to put their money where their mouth is and voluntarily send more money to the government, rather than raising taxes on hard-working Americans who know they're already sending too much of their hard-earned money to Washington. I applaud Rep. LaMalfa for joining me in re-introducing this important legislation. For years, American families have asked for tax relief, and now we delivered real tax relief for them, and those tax cuts are already working to create more jobs, higher pay, and a stronger economy. Anyone who still feels they are not sending enough to the government should have the ability to do so voluntarily, without burdening the rest of us hard-working families across the country who want to keep more of our own money in our paychecks. You're seeing on full display the laying of the foundation to impeach the president by the Democrats. They don't want to get the facts. They first want to know what their endgame is. Their endgame is to impeach the president whether or not the facts back it up. They've cast this wide net. This is beyond a witch hunt. This was all supposed to be about collusion with Russia. No collusion found between Russia and either presidential campaign. What they're doing is trying to find any excuse to go and appease their base who wants the president impeached. They want to reverse the outcome of the election where the American people said Donald Trump will be our president. Donald Trump is doing a great job, by the way, of following through on his promises as president to get our economy back on track. They aren't concerned about that. They want to shift back to socialism. The only way they can do it is impeach the president, whether the facts back it up or not. So far, from everything we've seen, the facts don't back it up, but they'll move there anyway. Making quality health coverage affordable for Louisiana families continues to be a top priority of mine. Obamacare was a total failure which increased costs and forced millions of Americans to lose the good coverage that they liked. As we work to bring healthcare costs down, it's obvious that socialized medicine is the exact opposite of what we need. The vast majority of Louisiana families understand this and are firmly against a one-size-fits-all, government-run health care program controlled by unelected bureaucrats in Washington. Working with President Trump, we made real progress recently by eliminating Obamacare's costly individual mandate, but there's still more work needed to repair the damage Obamacare did to our healthcare system. In my role as the House Majority Whip, I helped pass a bill that repeals Obamacare and replaces it with expanded choices that lower premiums and puts families back in charge of their health care decisions. I won't stop working until Louisiana fam"
Q862186," Today, the Navy and Marine Corps team collectively mourn the loss of four heroes. The tragedy in Chattanooga is both devastating and senseless. On behalf of the entire Department of the Navy family, I offer my deepest condolences to the families of those killed and wounded in service to our nation during this incident. Throughout history, our Sailors and Marines have served overseas, in harm's way, and the men and women of the Navy and Marine Corps have experienced the deep and lasting pain of combat loss. Today, here at home, we once again feel that pain. While we expect our Sailors and Marines to go into harm's way, and they do so without hesitation, an attack at home, in our community, is insidious and unfathomable. As the investigation unfolds, our priority will be to take care of the families of those affected. I'd like to express my gratitude to the first responders on the scene whose prompt reaction was critical to stopping this individual from inflicting further violence. Though we can never fully prevent attacks like this, we will continue to investigate, review and guard against future vulnerabilities and do everything in our power to safeguard the security of our service members and their families. The governor has long stated his wish to repeal the Hall Income tax. It penalizes saving and investing, and because it is concentrated on a small number of people coming or going from Tennessee, there can be significant shifts in revenue, making it undependable. He is concerned, however, with the approach taken to reduce and eliminate it. It is a small piece of a much larger puzzle we have tried to manage effectively and efficiently in state government. He often compares governing to a relay race, and he will hand off the baton to the next governor. As we move forward with this plan at this time, there will be more difficult decisions to be made. The state will not always have revenues like we had this year. The governor expects the legislators, advocacy groups and other stakeholders who have supported the automatic repeal of the Hall Tax to be equally strident in their support of this administration's efforts to find the efficiencies needed to meet the aggressive timetable set forth in this legislation. After careful consideration, I am declining to intervene in the case of Billy Ray Irick, who was convicted and sentenced to death in 1986 by a Knox County jury for the murder and aggravated rape of 7-year-old Paula Dyer. Irick requests clemency based upon his mental health status at the time the crime was committed. However, Irick was examined by a mental health expert and ruled competent to stand trial. The jury heard evidence regarding Irick's mental health during sentencing, and state and federal courts, including the Tennessee Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of the United States, have reviewed and upheld the jury's verdict and sentence on 17 different occasions, 11 of which occurred after additional evidence emerged years after the trial regarding his behavior in the weeks leading up to the offense. Both state and federal courts have ruled that the additional evidence does not undermine the jury's verdict or warrant a new trial, One of the most fun calls I have been able to make as governor was a call in 2015 to Sen. Henry when we knew we would be able to put funding for the new state museum in the budget. Sen. Henry was a tireless champion of the museum, its mission and the importance of preserving Tennessee history for future generations. His dedication to the museum may only be surpassed by his commitment to the state's financial strength. I was fortunate to be able to visit with Sen. Henry Friday, and I can attest that the state's finances were still top of mind to him. He served the state for nearly 50 years, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he is one of the primary reasons the state is on such solid financial footing today. He was a powerhouse intellect, courteous, kind, genuine and a statesman, and I will miss knowing that his wisdom and perspective are only a phone call away. Today I granted Lawrence McKinney's request for gubernatorial exoneration from his 1978 convictions. Though the facts of this case are complex and reasonable minds may draw different conclusions from them, ultimately I respect the determinations of the Shelby County Criminal Court and District Attorney General that Mr. McKinney was not guilty of the crimes for which he was convicted and would not have been prosecuted if the DNA testing results had been available at the time of trial. Mr. McKinney was released after more than 30 years in prison when the court set aside his convictions in 2009. In the eyes of the judicial system, Mr. McKinney is innocent. While I appreciate the hard work and recommendations of the Board of Parole, in this case I defer to the finding of the court charged with determining Mr. McKinney's guilt or innocence. Although Senate Bill 1556 has received attention for its perceived foc"
Q881188," We, the Congressional Delegation of the Great State of Utah, stand in solidarity with local Native Americans, the people of San Juan County and elected officials at the local, county and state levels of Utah government in opposition to the unilateral designation of the proposed Bears Ears national monument. The protection of our nation's historic, cultural and natural resources is among the noblest of pursuits and we agree that this unique part of our state needs to be preserved. However, turning our backs on the democratic process to do so undermines who we are as Americans. We support a solution where local voices are not only heard, but integrated into public land management. We don't have the capability of testing everybody. We would like to test to make sure that there's no backlog of people waiting that have symptoms. So, we have a screening process that we go through and those that have symptoms can make arrangements then to come and get a test. We have the ability to do that with virtually no backlog. We're having much more success giving the test. The challenge we face right now, to me, is a little bit on the laboratory side where we have a little bit of pinch points. The laboratory can't keep up with the tests that are being given. So, we're a little concerned about that. Jeanette and I join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing, and celebrating the life, of my friend Elder Robert D. Hales. I will always remember the honor of working alongside Elder Hales in efforts to lift and enhance some of our local institutions. He was always friendly. He was a man with no guile. I consider him an extraordinarily humble and spiritual leader. The state of Utah and its citizens are better because of his example and his personal ministry. He will be missed but not forgotten. My prayers are with his loving wife, Mary, and the Hales family at this time. Education has always been my number one priority. This major investment in per-student spending is going to make a noticeable difference for student success in Utah. This solution also allows us to invest in local road needs and make significant progress toward reducing some of the imbalances in our tax code. I appreciate Our Schools Now for bringing this issue to the forefront and the legislature for responding to the encouragement of the public, and look forward to working to pass the November ballot question and implementing the will of the voters. The allegations against Planned Parenthood are deeply troubling. Current Utah state law prohibits the use of state funds to provide abortions by Planned Parenthood or any other organization. The federal government has provided grants to Planned Parenthood, distributed through the Utah Department of Health. These funds are also prohibited from being used to perform abortions. In light of ongoing concerns about the organization, I have instructed state agencies to cease acting as an intermediary for pass-through federal funds to Planned Parenthood. Having Dan as a friend and a mentor has been one of the great blessings of my life. He helped me become a better governor, and I believe he had a very similar influence on everyone he worked with. There was just something about Dan. You could always count on him to be completely honest with you -- and he would give you perspective and insight that would go beyond the raw polling numbers. Dan is truly irreplaceable. I will miss his wise counsel and his friendship. Jeanette and I send our warmest sympathies and sincere love to Pat and his family. This is an example of the community coming together, having an idea that has resonated with the citizens of Kaysville and with the mayor and city council and working together saying, `How do we solve it? How do we get the money, raise private money, get a little taxpayer money and build this nice complex which will add to the ambience of and the quality of life of Kaysville?' It's a great example for all the communities in Utah of how to come together and solve some problems and create some really good opportunities for the quality of life. Like many Utahns, I was overjoyed this morning to hear Senator Orrin Hatch's news that after two long years, Josh Holt and his wife Thamy had been released from prison in Venezuela and are making their way home to Utah. I would like to personally thank those who have worked tirelessly to make Josh's release possible, including President Donald Trump, Senator Bob Corker, the members of Utah's congressional delegation and their staff. Josh's return comes in answer to many prayers. The people of Utah look forward to welcoming him home. This decision ignores the will of the majority of Utahns. It disregards the desire of Native American groups who count these lands as their heritage to co-manage this culturally important area. It overlooks the unanimous opposition of Utah's statewide elected officials and Utah's entire congressional delegation. It runs roughshod over a resolution "
Q971308," The economy is the best it's been in decades. Economic growth has accelerated, unemployment has dropped to record lows, middle-class wages are rising, and for the first time there are more job openings than there are people looking for a job. This is largely due to our historic tax reform and deregulatory efforts of the past two years. The president was right to underscore the significance of our progress. President Trump also made a reasonable case for enhancing security at our southern border. The obvious, necessary solution to our budget impasse is a compromise that improves border security -- including physical barriers where requested by Customs and Border Protection -- and delivers on some Democrat priorities, too. I hope Speaker Pelosi will come to the table and finally negotiate in good faith. On trade, I continue to believe that the administration is taking us down the wrong path. Tariffs on products imported into the United States are taxes, paid by American consumers, that harm American families and workers. Congress must reassert its constitutional responsibility on trade, not cede even more to the executive branch. China does engage in the egregious theft of intellectual property. The administration's negotiations with China should focus on ending this practice. I commend the president for his focus on health care. He is right to urge Congress to adopt reforms that will make health care more affordable and available to more Americans. And he is right to set the ambitious goals of ending HIV/AIDS and childhood cancer. I look forward to working with the president and my colleagues to achieve these goals. We have an intelligence committee, a Senate committee, that's bipartisan and they're conducting an investigation and it's got three parts. One part is what exactly were the Russians up to? What were they doing to try to interfere with our election, discredit our political process? There's no question they were up to no good and we should get to the bottom of exactly what they did and how the did it. Second question is was there collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians or was there not? They're investigating that. I'm confident they'll get an answer. The third thing is every bit as important to me, which is what was going on with spying on Americans? We know that was happening. The other two, there's a lot of questions but we know for a fact that there were American intelligence agencies spying on Americans and committing the felony of releasing that information, through leaks, to the public. We're going to continue that eligibility. No one loses coverage. What we are going to do, gradually over 7 years, is transition from the 90 percent federal share that Obamacare created and transition that to where the federal government is still paying a majority, but the state's are kicking in their fair share, an amount equivalent to what they pay for all the other categories of eligibility. Some of my conservative friends who are concerned that the bill doesn't go far enough. I am sympathetic about the kinds of reforms they would like to make to lower premiums through more market forces and greater freedom on the part of consumers, but I see this bill as a first step. An important step in the direction of repealing those portions of Obamacare that we can. Stabilizing the individual market which is collapsing and making important reforms to Medicaid. It's not the last step. President Trump's request for $5.7 billion in border security funding is reasonable and certainly deserves a counter proposal, at the very least. But (House) Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi has refused to negotiate. Now, President Trump is offering Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats some of their top legislative priorities in an effort to end this partial government shutdown. The president's offer, which is based on the bipartisan BRIDGE Act introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) - -- who serves as the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate - -- would provide legal status to DACA and Temporary Protected Status recipients for three years. Importantly, the offer also extends the Violence Against Women Act and provides more than $12 billion in disaster relief. The Senate will vote on this sensible plan this week. Speaker Pelosi should allow the House to do the same. President Trump's request for $5.7 billion in border security funding is reasonable and certainly deserved a counter proposal, at the very least.

Q16187041," People have had substitutes take their SAT for them in the past, but they've really have tighten the security on that. In this case, it looks like there was a Harvard grad that would actually pretend to be a proctor and then would either take a test or correct the answers for students. So that was one avenue to be able to try and get an application to be accepted, which is to change the test scores... The other could be a near-perfect crime, which is coaches have pretty broad discretion over who they want to recruit to be members of their teams and most schools will lower the admission requirement for athletes. While I was President we did not do that at UNF and as a result, it's one of the rare universities in the country where every single team is above a 3.0-grade point average. In this case the coaches were asking for what is known as an `athletic exemption,' which means admitting an athlete with grades or test scores that aren't the norm, but taking a bribe for it and some of the athletes weren't even close to really being of a talent that would be worthy of the team. For men's basketball team, for example, there's twelve spots and the last couple players may never really play much. A coach can go ahead and bring a couple of those people in and not really hurt the team's effort. Our efforts as a nation to identify our hostages that are held overseas is way insufficient. We need to be doing a much better job finding these people. It should be our absolute top priority. We saw specific examples where we had to get involved, where the resources of the government were coordinated as well as they should be to really bring to bear all of the capabilities and resources and talents and expertise the U.S. Government has. This needs to become a much bigger priority for our country. We cannot let Americans be held overseas and not be finding them. What happened here, there needs to be an investigation about what happened specifically around the events that caused Warren's death. The key is we didn't find him. We had several years to try to find him and we didn't find him. We were involved in this tragic accident that resulted in his loss of life. His country let him down. It might be wrong that whoever in the FAI earns `X' amount, but the reality is that if you gave every club here a million quid, almost all of them would spend it on players' wages rather than developing infrastructure and reaching out to their communities. Last year our crowds went up by 21% to an average of around 2,200, which is back to the level of our championship-winning 2009 season. Although we finished fifth, our home form was terrible so I'd argue that people were coming for the experience as much as the actual football. We're selling substantial amounts of merchandise and attracting football tourists from abroad who tend to spend big when they're at Dalymount. The plan, once we have our new stadium, is to grow our crowds to 5,000 and have a club that obviously strives for success on the pitch, but isn't going to go out of business if we're not qualifying every seson for Europe. Through our partnership with the James Beard Foundation, we are pleased to introduce an array of incredible culinary superstars aboard our ships. An exciting component of the new multi-year partnership is to pay special attention to both our acclaimed chefs and also to notable wine and mixology experts. Because we believe great meals deserve to be paired with great wines, cocktails, and beers indicative of the region in which we're sailing. These chefs and beverage experts are all selected because of their connections to the countries they are visiting on their cruise -- either through their own family heritage or their gastronomic passions. Because Windstar and the James Beard Foundation both are dedicated to making food more delicious, diverse, and sustainable for everyone, we make a great pairing. Our exclusive partnership with the James Beard Foundation has allowed us to enrich our culinary experiences giving our guests unparalleled access to the most cutting edge and accomplished culinarians in the industry. Every evening, on every single sailing, our cruise guests enjoy destination-inspired JBF dishes created especially for Windstar by the James Beard guest chefs who have sailed with us. We have proudly hosted nearly three dozen chefs, sommeliers and beverage experts and counting. What is unique is that each one has a special connection to the places they are sailing, whether through food or family heritage, this creates powerful and inspiring personal experiences that our guests will never forget, We can sail up rivers and dock in the central areas of Shanghai, Ho Chi Minh City, and Bangkok. We can anchor off Patong Bay in Phuket, Thailand and small islands in Indonesia like Pulau Bawean on the Java Sea. We visit small ports in the Philippines giving our guests access to places found at the top of Condé Nast Traveler's Best Islands and Best Beaches lists."
Q6388290," The State Bar has chosen the wrong tool to achieve the benefits of diversity. Instead of trusting its membership to vote for the most qualified candidates to collectively represent their interests, it has chosen to enforce strict racial and sex-based quotas for its leadership. But the State Bar is a government agency, and governmental quotas on race and sex are anathema to equal protection under the law. Quotas make bare the indignity of a naked racial and sex-based classification, because they define an individual's sole worth based on an immutable trait. In the eyes of the State Bar, you either are or are not a minority member, and that single quality defines whether you can or cannot serve in a specific government role. These quotas are utterly unjustified and patently unconstitutional. While we appreciate the time and effort that went into the agreement between the parties and the U.S. Dept. of Justice, the Texas Attorney General has an independent obligation to protect Texas consumers. After careful evaluation of the proposed merger and the settlement, we do not anticipate that the proposed new entrant will replace the competitive role of Sprint anytime soon. It is the Attorney General's responsibility to preserve free market competition, which has proven to result in lower prices and better quality for consumers. The bargain struck by the U.S. Dept. of Justice is not in the best interest of working Texans, who need affordable mobile wireless telecommunication services that are fit to match the speed and technological innovation demands of Texas' growing economy. Acts of violence against our brave law enforcement in Texas will not be tolerated. We should take all steps necessary to prosecute those who commit them to the fullest extent possible under the law. I commend the Harris County Sheriff's office and the Harris County DA's office for their swift work apprehending and charging this dangerous criminal for this heinous murder of a Texas law enforcement officer. The Texas Attorney General's office extends its deepest condolences to Deputy Goforth's wife and children, family and friends during this time of unimaginable grief. We should never forget the sacrifice that law enforcement and their supportive families make when officers go out each day to ensure the safety of our families and the safety of our communities. Today, the United States Supreme Court hears an important case that will define ordered liberty and self-government under the United States Constitution. At stake in this case is whether the people of the State of Texas-and people in the states across the nation-can make their own laws defining marriage. Seventy-six percent of Texas voters chose to define marriage as being between one man and one woman and I am committed to defending the Texas Constitution and self-government by Texans. That is why I joined with Louisiana and other states in filing an amicus brief in the United States Supreme Court defending the will of the people of Texas. I'm pleased but hardly surprised that the U.S. Supreme Court upheld President Trump's travel ban. We were confident all along that the executive order on immigration is a lawful exercise of the president's statutorily authorized executive power over foreign affairs and national security. The travel ban is a carefully crafted approach to upgrading vetting and national security procedures critical to protecting Texas and the rest of the nation from terrorism. The Constitution places decisions like that in the hands of the president and Congress, not unelected federal judges, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized. I was on the show, one of my law enforcement guys called, because I was just sitting in the chair and they were coming to me periodically, and he was giving me information. He said, `I have no reason to believe this isn't the same person.' So that's what I gave to Sean Hannity. When I got off the show, I called the Austin PD chief and talked to him. He gave me a different version, saying they were pretty sure it was unrelated, that it was an incendiary device that somebody threw in the Goodwill, so the early report was different from what the chief gave me, so I just give the information I get as I go along. The city hall houses numerous non-judicial city administrative offices that are not identified as places where weapons are prohibited... Section 46.03 (a) (3) of the Penal Code does not allow a political subdivision to prohibit licensed handgun holders from entering into an entire building simply because government courts or the offices of the courts are located in a portion of that multipurpose building. Consequently, the OAG has determined the signs at the entrance of the city hall, as well as the oral communications utilized by city hall security officers, are in violation of the Government Code. In the Attorney General's opinion my office issued in response to Lt. Governor Patrick's request for guidance, we find that although i"
Q1135774," Now is the time to take unprecedented steps to stop North Korea. This latest nuclear test by Kim Jong Un may be the clearest sign that we have seen that they are ready and willing to start a nuclear war that would lead to unimaginable destruction and loss of life on the Korean Peninsula. The international community needs to finally join together in completely isolating this dangerous regime. North Korea should be immediately kicked out of the United Nations and under the leadership of the United States, the United Nations Security Council should enact a new resolution that imposes a full economic embargo on North Korea that bans all of Pyongyang's economic activities, including petroleum resources, except for limited humanitarian exceptions. I am also continuing to call on the Administration to block all entities that do business with North Korea, no matter where they are based, from conducting any financial activities through the U.S. financial system. My bipartisan legislation would achieve this goal and I am ready to work with the Administration and leaders in Congress to pass this bill immediately. These economic tools need to be combined with robust military deterrent, including imposing a US-led international naval blockade of North Korea in order to ensure a full enforcement of United Nations actions. We must also continue frequent show of force exercises by the United States and our partners in Seoul and Tokyo, enhanced missile defense activities, and assurance of extended U.S. nuclear deterrence to our allies. Kim Jong Un must know that any serious provocation will be met with a full range of U.S. military capabilities. After 31 years, the American people will no longer be forced to deal with an Atari-era tax code that is outdated and overly complicated. Congress has finally answered the call to cut taxes and reform the tax code, and I'm proud to help deliver this relief to all of Colorado. At the beginning of this process, my goal was to bring relief to hardworking Coloradans throughout the four corners of our great state, and I'm proud that after months of work we have achieved this goal. Coloradans at every income level will receive a tax cut and popular provisions that help hardworking Coloradans like greater tax relief for childcare services, the student loan interest deduction, the medical expense deduction, and tax breaks for teachers are all part of the final bill. After years of complacency and being told we have to accept meager economic growth, the American people will once again see their economy accelerate. This tax relief package will lead to economic growth, higher wages, and more jobs. The American people sent their representatives to Washington to bring relief and I'm proud to have delivered on this promise during the first year of a unified Republican government. if you remember, though, Otto Warmbier was murdered by Kim Jong-un during the watch of President Trump. That happened on the watch of President Trump. What has happened differently since that action, since that death, that tragic death, is the application of maximum pressure. Something I have sought for many years that we started in Congress with the passage of my legislation and the North Korea sanctions enhancement policy, The Enhancement Act. That started to apply a pressure doctrine that President Trump has utilized to the best extent possible. And continues to put the economic, diplomatic pressure on the regime. As a result of that, you see how Otto Warmbier was treated. And you now see the three individuals coming home. I'm thankful, and this country is blessed they are coming home. We have to do more. We can't give up on the pressure. The only reason this is happening is because President Trump believes in the maximum-pressure doctrine. This wouldn't have happened under the strategic patience doctrine. I applaud the president's call for unity tonight. It's time that we come together as a country, and for Democrats and Republicans to work together on issues to achieve a compromise for Dreamers and make needed investments to our nation's crumbling infrastructure. I was pleased the president also highlighted how the tax cuts have already resulted in billions of dollars of investment and wage growth. We must continue to grow the economy and reduce the burden of Washington on hardworking Americans. While urban areas along the Front Range are thriving, the forgotten corners of our state and country are not seeing the same level of success. We must do better for all America. Advertisement Many of the goals outlined tonight will serve as a blueprint for what Congress can achieve for the American people in the coming year, and I hope Democrats and Republicans will work together to move our country forward. I applaud the President's call for unity tonight. It's time that we come together as a country, and for Democrats and Republicans to work together on issues to achieve a compromise for Dreamers and make needed investment"
Q16215583," Many of these states had previously expressed serious interest in pursuing an independent opt-out path. While we were successful in working with First Net to remove the unreasonable fees and penalties, the decision deadline of December 28th approached too quickly for these other states to feel confident in an opt-out decision. As a result, it now appears likely that no other states will opt-out. While Rivada's plan remains the better option for New Hampshire, I have determined that the additional risk associated with being the only state to opt-out creates too high a barrier for New Hampshire to continue down the opt-out path alone.... By moving to opt-in today, New Hampshire will retain AT&T's commitment to build 48 new tower sites across the state. These new sites will lead to a top quality public safety network for our first responders and enhanced coverage for all of our citizens. I look forward to working with AT&T as they begin the build out and deployment of their New Hampshire plan, and I pledge to continue our efforts to ensure that FirstNet remains responsive to the public safety needs of every state. As New Hampshire's largest insurer, today's announcement by Anthem is incredible news for New Hampshire's insurance market and the Granite Stater's who rely on the individual market for their care. As states across the country are watching carriers pull out and their markets collapse, New Hampshire has bucked the trend. This welcome news is the result of a rigorous effort to stabilize New Hampshire's market. As I have previously stated, my administration has been engaged in an intensive and productive dialogue with our insurers to do whatever we can to keep them in New Hampshire's individual market. This includes: providing flexibility in filing deadlines with our state's Department of Insurance (NHID), authorizing NHID and our Department of Health and Human Services to pursue any waiver opportunities, strong advocacy of Cost Savings Reduction (CSR) payments and a commitment to do whatever we can to provide certainty at the state level. We continue to await official word from Harvard Pilgrim, and we will continue working to help ensure that New Hampshire has a competitive market place. Today, Executive Councilor Chris Sununu called on Governor Hassan and Commissioner Meyers to cancel the current contract with Dartmouth Hitchcock for their mental health services following the revelation that more than 450 employees are to be laid off. This vital piece of information was clearly withheld from the Governor and Council during the negotiations and debate of their $36 million contract. Councilor Sununu has called for a rebid of the contract since June and continues that call today. Councilor Sununu has been in contact with Commissioner Meyers and other Councilors on this matter. He has reiterated his strong concerns about the state doing business with any organization that withholds such important information over a public contract. The President is wrong. It's disappointing his mischaracterization of this epidemic ignores the great things this state has to offer. Our administration inherited one of the worst health crises this state has ever experienced, but we are facing this challenge head on. We have doubled our resources to support prevention, treatment and recovery; dedicated millions to law enforcements (sic) efforts to keep drugs out of our state, increased the availability of naloxone, and are rebuilding our prevention programs for our kids. We are already seeing positive signs of our efforts as overdoses and deaths are declining in key parts of the state. In spite of this crisis, New Hampshire remains the best place to live, work and raise a family. Today, the President saw first-hand the groundbreaking work New Hampshire is doing to combat the opioid crisis. I was joined by Mayor Joyce Craig and General Mikolaities on the tarmac at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport to greet the President, where Mayor Craig and I stressed the need for adequate federal funding as we tackle this crisis head-on. As Governor, I will always take the opportunity to advocate for our state, and today New Hampshire's leaders showed the President our unique programs, which have the ability to serve as a model of best practice across this country. We were one of the first states into this crisis, but I have no doubt that we will be the first state out of it. It's our understanding that a lot of towns have already made a choice to cancel their town votes tomorrow -- not cancel, but postpone, I should say, their elections. There is some differing opinion on the state level as to the wherewithal, whether that is a valid process for them to take. Given that there are differing opinions, the best we can do is strongly recommend that all towns stay open for voting tomorrow. We think that's a very important part of the process, but given those differing opinions, I don't think we're in a position to mandate that towns stay open "
Q16194125," On 03/26/20 at (1:01 a.m.), Officer Brown and Officer Heshley heard a gun shot in the 3rd St. NW/Central Ave. NW area. Officers arrived on scene approximately 10-15 seconds later. Officer Brown noticed a black 2019 Jeep vehicle parked facing eastbound in front of 312 Central Ave. SW. Officers noticed a black 2019 Jeep vehicle and two unknown homeless subjects. The vehicle engine was on and the vehicle was in park. Officer Brown engaged his emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop. He made contact with the black 2019 Jeep vehicle driver Jonathan Jones. Officer Brown asked him about the gun shot and Jonathan said he didn't know anything. Officer Brown observed signs of intoxication and asked for a DWI saturation unit. I was working DWI saturation and was dispatched to the traffic stop. I made contact with Jonathan Jones. I observed that he had bloodshot, watery eyes and a strong odor of alcohol coming from his facial region. He admitted to driving earlier and had the intention to drive now. I asked him to exit the vehicle. Jonathan did field sobriety tests and performed poorly on all three of them. He also performed poorly on two out of three alternative tests. He was searched and arrested. He was transported to the (Prisoner Transport Center) where he was read the N.M. implied consent advisory and given the Intoxilyzer 8000 breath test. He was given a deprivation period from (1:02 a.m.) until (1:48 a.m.). Prior to administration of the aforementioned breath test, his mouth was checked at (1:02 a.m.) and found to be clear of any foreign objects. Test results were at or above twice the legal limit. He was checked through (Motor Vehicle Department) and found to have one prior DWI arrest. During the tow inventory of the vehicle, a black handgun was found underneath the driver seat. A 1/2 empty bottle of Recuerdo 750ml was found behind the passenger side of the vehicle. The handgun was tagged into evidence. Jonathan was unable to provide the vehicle's valid insurance paperwork. He was booked on the listed charges. His vehicle was towed. A copy of the lapel camera was tagged into evidence. Much like Yale's disclosure of its data breach last year that it suffered between 2008 and 2009, it could only be a matter of days before affected individuals begin to file class-action lawsuits against GeorgiaTech for failing to comply with privacy regulations. The financial implications of this breach are likely to be significant -- not only in terms of lawsuits and fees for failing to comply with data privacy regulations, but also in terms of damaged reputation. Students were outraged at a similar breach in July 2018 when the university mistakenly shared the personal information of about 8,000 students in the College of Computing with other students at the school. This latest breach will surely add fuel to the fire. When organizations are entrusted with highly confidential information, such as Social Security numbers, it becomes the organization's responsibility to protect it. Georgia Tech's incident should serve as a wake-up call for other colleges to leverage automated security solutions. By implementing seamless and continuous policy enforcement, organizations can provide a framework for successfully reducing risk and maintaining compliance across an entire IT environment. These types of tools are especially important for large organizations, like prominent universities, that have complex and dispersed IT environments, spread over multiple campuses and individual colleges/departments. On March 7th, after a series of examinations by leading physicians in the field of hearing loss, I was advised that if I continue to perform at large venues, I risked total deafness. While I was horrified at the reality of the news that day, I had for a time become aware that my partial hearing loss was beginning to interfere with my performance on stage. I was having difficulty hearing the guitars on stage and because I was not able to hear the other musicians clearly, I feared the quality of my performance could be compromised. In all honesty this was something I could not in good conscience allow. Our fans deserve my performance to be at the highest level, and if for any reason I can't deliver that level of performance I will not disappoint our fans or embarrass the other members of AC/DC. I am not a quitter and I like to finish what I start, nevertheless, the doctors made it clear to me and my bandmates that I had no choice but to stop performing on stage for the remaining shows and possibly beyond. That was the darkest day of my professional life. Give Tesla its due -- it has managed to ramp production, and while we don't think 5k/week is sustainable for a full quarter in 3Q or 4Q, it should continue to ramp -- we forecast Model 3 production of 43k and 52k in 3Q and 4Q, respectively, up from 29k in 2Q. For the blue-pillers (aka uberbulls), this is important as it demonstrates the trajectory of datapoints is positive. However, so"
Q5725737," We know that's going on all over the country. It's not just in South Carolina. I know there's been investigation for months -- even over a year -- I understand the announcements will be coming soon on the results of that, but we got a lot of work to do in our prisons there's no doubt about that and prisons are dangerous places. People go to prison because they've caused pain, they've hurt people, they've done things that are abhorrent to society. But the first thing we have to do, we need prison reform, of course, all over the country. The first thing we have to do is get those cell phones out of the prisons, keep them from going in there. There is a federal law to keep us from doing that. It is illegal to have them in the prison. It' s illegal to take them in the prison, all those things are legal, but they are secured in there, they are smuggled in there, but until we can block the signals on the cell phones, we are allowing people that are in the prisons to communicate and continue doing those things they were doing on the outside of the prisons. That is the one thing that, the one single thing that we can do to make a difference and director [ Bryan ] Stirling and I have been working on and vigorously. I think the children, it appears that these school children -- these innocent school children -- are being used as a tool by these left-wing groups to further their own agenda. It is not about the tragedy, it's not about the school children or what we should all do and what these students should do. I imagine a lot of them intend to do is pray and to hope for the families of those who were slain, but this is a tricky move, I believe, by a left-wing group from the information I've seen, to use these children as a tool to further their own means. It sounds like a protest to me, it's not a memorial, it's certainly not a prayer service, it's a political statement by a left-wing group and it's shameful. The House of Representatives and I have remained steadfast in our belief that there is no acceptable amount for South Carolinians to continue paying into the failed nuclear reactors at VC Summer, and today, the House took a vote that shows the people of this great state that they will join me in continuing to fight for them. Doing the right thing on behalf of the people we have been elected to serve should always take priority over the concerns of any company, and in the strongest possible terms, I urge the Senate to do the right thing and make sure no South Carolinian pays another dime for power plants they will never get. We are making progress. Under the proposed agreement between SCANA and Dominion Energy, SCE&G ratepayers will get most of the money back they paid for the nuclear reactors and will no longer face paying billions for this nuclear collapse. But this doesn't resolve the issue. Over seven hundred thousand electric cooperative customers face the prospect of having their power bills sky rocket for decades to pay off Santee Cooper's $4 billion in debt from this. The only way to resolve this travesty is to sell Santee Cooper. There is more work to be done, but today, we are headed in the right direction. I am grateful to Governor Henry McMaster, the South Carolina Senate, and the Joint Citizens & Legislative Committee on Children for the opportunity to serve as our state's first State Child Advocate and Director of the Department of Children's Advocacy (DCA). Over the past few weeks, I have met and spoken with leadership from other agencies, new internal DCA team members and community child advocates. I am thankful and humbled by the confidence and encouragement they have conveyed and am committed to being focused and intentional regarding advocacy, accountability and service for children. But not in that particular rooming house. As you know, students act like students, college students that live on the college campus. They break a lot of things. We fix them as fast as we can. The rooming house is a little bit different. We rent to people there, it's on a weekly basis. It's all they can afford. A lot of these people would be on the street if we didn't have a place for them there. It's a nice business. We enjoy doing it. We're renovating all the time. Those particular photographs [ in the Oct. 24 Post and Courier story ] came from things that are under renovation right now. Chief Burgess has dedicated his life to serving South Carolinians as a law enforcement officer and has an astounding body of work to show for it. Most importantly, he's a great man who has proven he has the qualities that would have made him a transformational leader at the Department of Public Safety. That he is prioritizing his family over his nomination to lead the agency says all anyone needs to know about Chief Burgess, and I find great comfort in knowing that he's not going far and will continue to serve our people through his leadership at the North Charleston Police Department. I'm unhappy to say I'm not expecting miracl"
Q4773428," Listen, I think -- I don't know this for a fact, that probably came from the president. He likes to be respected. He was probably frustrated at that moment. What I would do in a situation like that, I'd pull a tape of questions that Sam Donaldson screamed at Ronald Reagan and go right through the last 30 years of pool reporters asking questions that presidents probably think are obnoxious or untoward or disrespectful questions and just point out that she was doing her job. So I understand that she was put in the penalty box. I would certainly recommend to my former colleagues that you take her out of the penalty box. I've said this consistently, and I will continue to say this to anybody who listens, having a war declaration or having that level of antagonism with the president does not help the president, does not serve his interests going into the midterms or the elections. I understand the frustration, and I understand his personality where he likes to punch back and be combative. What I think that also does, and I think you'll agree with me, it galvanizes the president vis-a-vis the White House. I was watching one of the press conferences where I think it was a gentleman from Politico yielded to the woman from NBC. So what you're doing is you're starting to galvanize people against the White House, and it's a collective which I think is not in the best interest of the president. So, one, I don't like that decision. Number two, it probably came from the president himself. You know, I'm super not not happy with that. I like her as a person, but if you remember Father Coughlin the 1930s, my grandparents certainly remember him, it's the same rhetoric. It's the same sentence structure. It's the same level of xenophobia that my immigrant grandparents faced as Italian-Americans 70, 80 short years ago. I'm not in love with it. I love the concept of America, the great of experiment of our great republic. We really are as Lincoln said, the last best hope for mankind. We have our diversity. We get our strength from that diversity. One last point, Lee Kuan Yew once said about America, we have such a competitive advantage around the world because you can come to the United States as a Chinese or a German and become a German-American or a Chinese-American, but that's not true going to those other countries. So that's a huge competitive advantage that we have versus the rest of the world in terms of the intellectual capital. Three or four different things. Number one he is a maniacal bully filled with anger and rage and obviously just look at the feed he is completely unhinged. They are afraid they could get primaried because right now he has a personality cult stranglehold like a McCarthy fever going on in the party. The third thing I think they're afraid of is that they have great uncertainty about the 2020 election. So in their consensus about a month ago he is winning. He's the president. The economy is booming. And now they're like, `Okay. he's crazy, but he's winning, and the economy is booming.' Now they're like `he's crazy and the economy is having a rate of change.' You guys know I'm running $10 billion and I study the economy very carefully. I'm not saying it is going into recession by the end of 2020, but it is going to slow down. You can totally feel it because of all the unpredictability about the trade. Whether you agree with the president or you disagree with the president, you have to love the institution of the presidency. You have to love the office, and you have to love our country. And what is going on right now, I've done a major amount of work over the last five days. I've interviewed most of the assistants to the president. I've interviewed most of the people in the communications team in the White House. And what the president and I would like to tell everybody, we have a very, very, good idea who the leakers are, who the senior leakers are in the White House. We will get to that second. What I also want to say is that we are working together, the president and myself, and other members of his team, and law enforcement to undercut and undercover, out if you will, the leakers in the entire country. But when you're meeting science and you're not meeting subjective feeling, and now you're meeting objective data and objective science, he lit a fuse on the original playbook, which is you deflect, you distract, you exaggerate where things are going to make people feel better, to put, quote/unquote, people at ease psychologically. `Everything is going to be okay. We're going from 15 to zero.' Then it became irrefutable what was going on, just by looking at the numbers. People that understand math and statistics know that you have an exponential problem, and if it is ten times worse than the flu, the only question is, `Are we moving quick enough?' I've been very critical of the president. I'm not going to hold back on my criticism. They're going to get fired. I'm just going to make it very, very clear"
Q539444," I am deeply disturbed by reports that the Administration is planning to cut the number of American troops in Afghanistan by half. Among my concerns are that such a move would: complicate the remaining troops ability to protect themselves; cause coalition partners to reduce their presence as well; set back progress in helping the Afghan security forces be able to provide for their country's security; relieve pressure on the Taliban at a critical juncture in peace negotiations; and allow ISIS, Al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups in Afghanistan to rebuild and eventually launch terrorist attacks against Americans. Considerable progress has been made in the last two years against terrorist organizations in a variety of places around the world. Reducing the American presence in Afghanistan and removing our presence in Syria will reverse that progress, encourage our adversaries, and make America less safe. Part of reform is getting more money for the money we spend; and, as Chuck mentioned, the contract that has combined Y-12 and Pantex has been successful in reducing overhead. What that means is there's more money that can go out to the front lines to the people who are actually touching the stuff and making a difference to keep our nuclear deterrent credible. I think it's worked well. A lot of that is to the credit of the people who manage that contract -- and the workers at both sites. We'll keep watching to make sure it goes well. Neither site wants to work for the other, but if it can be managed with cost savings so that more resources can actually be devoted to doing the work... that's a great thing and maybe that's a model that can be used elsewhere. We ask a lot of our men and women in the Navy. The time they spend at sea is increasing, while their ships age and their funding gets cut. These are just the conditions that can lead to an increase in the kinds of accidents we are witnessing. At a time of increasing threats, two military services have now had to take a knee to review safety and training procedures. That is unprecedented, and no way to protect America. Congress has a duty to provide our sailors with the additional resources they so clearly need, and to do so immediately. To do any less, while these sailors are doing so much for us, would be immoral. The technology to print items that formerly were required to be manufactured presents a host of difficult issues as well as opportunities. One of the challenges is how the federal government would enforce some kind of limitation on what could be printed as well as whether other countries would comply. As in so many areas, the technology moves far faster than the law or public policy. Rather than attempt to address concerns with hasty, knee-jerk reactions, Congress and the American people will have to understand what is possible, where technology is headed, and how concerns might be addressed. Opponents of this bill argue that we should put our urgent national security needs on hold until we reach a similar consensus on a whole host of other domestic programs. That is the approach we have taken for the past six years and the results are indisputable: the number of our troops killed in training accidents is increasing, our military capabilities are eroding, our enemies have become emboldened, and America is less secure. To continue to use defense funding as a political football in the face of these undisputed consequences is irresponsible. Among the information missing is the proposed location for a new detention facility. More than seven years after he first ordered the detention center at [ Guantanamo Bay ] closed, I find it telling that the White House has either failed to work out these important details or they know, but refuse to disclose them, to the American public. It suggests to me that the President is more interested in fulfilling a campaign promise at any cost, than in transparently addressing the risk associated with bringing terrorists to the United States. Service Members shouldn't have to worry about whether their next duty station can support the medical needs of their family or whether they will be able to afford safe, reliable child care. The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted many of these daily challenges. This effort is an extension of the bipartisan family readiness reforms the House Armed Services Committee has championed in the past, including the new blended retirement system, reforms the military healthcare system, and repeated reforms of the widow's tax. The Army's emphasis on getting new technologies into the hands of our troops faster is commendable, and we appreciate the Service's willingness to work closely with the Armed Services Committee on this critical issue. The push to fund more experimentation and prototyping of weapons is not only an important step in simplifying and reforming the acquisition process, it is essential to our security, helping us keep pace with our adversaries, and maintaining the United"
Q881196," I think that it's a very poorly written bill -- it's written by people who want to recreation (sic) with marijuana. There's got to be some fixes to it. According to the Attorney General and others who have read it, they say that because the law is written, anybody can buy it, including adolescent children. I'm concerned about that -- I think there needs to be some work done there. I'm also very, very concerned what the cost is going to be. I need about $5 million from the Legislature to build the infrastructure in the Department of Agriculture. I'm going to ask them to send it over to BABLO -- we already have the infrastructure there -- and then I think it's a matter of writing the rules. Personally, if there was ever a bill that the Legislature should just kibosh, that's it. I'm also going to ask that we increase the taxation on it. Secondly, we got ta get rid of medical marijuana. If you've got recreational marijuana, it's over the counter -- why do we need medical marijuana? I see no need -- you like, Bayer aspirin, you don't need a prescription to buy Bayer aspirin, so why do you need a prescription to buy recreational marijuana or medical marijuana? Everyone agrees Maine's heroin problem has escalated into a public health crisis. But politicians differ on how to handle it. My administration is focused right now on attacking the supply side of the problem. We need more law enforcement officials on the streets, hunting down drug dealers and stopping them from selling poison in our state. However, as we have said repeatedly, we are not looking to arrest drug addicts. We are going after the organized drug dealers who run these illegal operations like a very profitable business. We need to shut them down wherever we can.... We absolutely agree that more treatment, education and recovery efforts are needed. If the Legislature wants to create a comprehensive plan to increase both law enforcement and treatment, we welcome it.... If they have not informed me by December 10 that they are planning to fund these new agents, I will take action. That's why I will use every resource available to me to fight these drug traffickers, including temporary support from the National Guard. Governor LePage, himself a victim of child abuse (as Maine media has documented), has a zero-tolerance policy regarding domestic abuse. He has made fighting domestic violence a signature policy initiative of his two terms as Governor. No accusations, allegations or evidence of domestic violence on the part of David Sorenson were ever brought to the attention of the Governor or the First Lady. Nor were they brought to the attention of the Governor's staff during David's employment in the Governor's Office. Without an allegation or evidence, there was nothing upon which the Governor could take action. Any allegation that the Governor or First Lady had any knowledge of a violent or abusive relationship relating to the Sorensens is totally false. When complaints about domestic or sexual abuse are made to Governor LePage, he actively pursues investigations. No visitor to Gov. Paul R. LePage's office suite can miss the framed message on the wall, opposite the main door: `Don't expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong.' It is a quote from Calvin Coolidge, used as wall art -- and an indication of the combative philosophy of government under a Republican governor who has, time and again, generated headlines over vulgar and racially charged remarks.... But beyond the offensive comments, lawmakers from both parties describe confounding difficulties under Mr. LePage, who they say has instigated dramatic shifts in the state's political atmosphere, thrown wrenches into basic workings of state government, and made a habit of outbursts that even his allies concede distract from his political accomplishments.... The leaders of the Republican party -- the president of the Senate, the minority leader in the House, and the governor of the state of Maine -- have to get behind closed doors, lock it, and they all come out as a team... It's not about us as individuals, it's about the people of the state of Maine and the Republican party... It's important that this party get it right... we need to get together, we need to bury the bad blood, bury the hatchet, bury the past and move forward because if we don't, we could break that string from 2006. And it is so, so important for myself and my wife that we leave Maine in good hands. Our major employment opportunities throughout Maine are in tourism and retail industries, which are predominantly minimum-wage jobs. Minimum-wage jobs are not filled by students and teenagers -- they are filled by breadwinners. Living wage for a single person is $23,961.60; 23 percent of Knox County households make $25,000 or less (2013 factfinder. census. gov). So while he offers aspiration for good-paying jobs -- the responsibility of the Legislature, and, I would hope, together with the governor, is to develop policy t"
Q1525924," America has come a long way in the first year of the Trump administration. As the president made clear tonight, our economy is finally giving Americans a reason to be optimistic about their future, and the future of their kids and grandkids. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which marked the first major tax reform in more than three decades, has already benefited more than three million Americans who have received bonuses, wage increases, or enhanced benefits. Next month, the vast majority of U.S. workers will be taking home more money in their paycheck. Many of our nation's largest employers have announced billions in new investments that will create good-paying jobs, fuel economic growth, and expand opportunity in the years ahead. On top of that, the president and Congress have eliminated hundreds of regulations that either weren't needed or weren't working, saving our economy billions. It's been a good year for Missouri families, but our work is far from finished. I was glad to hear the president focus on the need to improve our outdated infrastructure. I look forward to working with him to ensure Missouri maintains its competitive advantage as a hub for our nation's highways, railways, and waterways. The president also addressed the opioid epidemic that is destroying lives in our state and across the nation. I've been proud to lead efforts to increase funding for programs targeting the opioid crisis, and will continue working to ensure we have the resources and policies in place to help more people get the treatment they need. And, as a member of the Intelligence Committee, I hear all the time that we are facing more threats from more directions than ever before. The president and Congress' most important responsibility is keeping Americans safe, and we will continue working together to make sure our men and women in uniform have what they need to carry out their missions. Today's announcement marks a dangerous step forward in the advancement of Iran's illicit nuclear program and confirms that the president was desperate to get a deal with Iran, at any price. This is a bad deal for the United States and one that will embolden our adversaries and jeopardize the security of our allies. The stated goal of the negotiations was to ensure Iran never develops the capability to produce a nuclear weapon, yet the president agreed to a deal that does the opposite. By allowing Iran to become nuclear weapons capable and failing to provide for `anytime anywhere' inspections, this deal gives Iran a free pass to cheat at its military sites with no access to U.S. inspectors. In return, the president agreed to give Iran hundreds of millions of dollars in sanctions relief. Meanwhile, just last week Iran continued its calls for the destruction of Israel and `death to America' as Iran's Supreme Leader stood by calling for the need to fight the U.S. even if there is an agreement. This deal undermines the security of our friends and allies and legitimizes Iran's unapologetic sponsorship of terrorism throughout the Middle East. I fully support President Trump's commitment to secure the border and build physical barriers wherever they are needed. I have repeatedly said that securing the border has to be the first step in addressing our immigration issues. There are several existing authorities that could be used to support what President Trump wants to do at the border without creating a court case or declaring an emergency. I have encouraged him to use those authorities. This issue will be settled in the courts. That could take months and result in future Presidents having emergency authority to use in other ways. Democrats have already made clear that they believe they could use this same authority to impose policies like gun control or the Green New Deal. Those decisions should not be made without congressional action. I was aggressively opposed to the Obama administration's attempts to circumvent Congress's appropriating authority to prop up Obamacare. The same principle should apply regardless of which party occupies the White House. This year's government funding bill includes the largest annual defense increase in 15 years. It will ensure our military men and women get the pay raise they deserve and have the equipment and training they need. I'm particularly glad to see several Missouri defense priorities reflected in the measure, including funding for the new National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency West headquarters, as well as critical investments at Whiteman, Rosecrans, Fort Leonard Wood, Lake City, and Missouri National Guard installations across the state. With Missouri being home to nearly 500,000 veterans, I'm also proud to say the bill provides a record level of Veterans Administration funding, while increasing oversight and modernization efforts. I'll continue working to ensure our service members have the resources they need to fulfill their missions, and the care and benefits they've earned as veterans. Middle and l"
Q331278," In my 25 years representing North Carolina in Congress, I have cast thousands of votes, each with their own significance. I approached today's vote with sober and deliberate consideration, conscious of my Constitutional responsibility to serve as an impartial juror. The Senate's role is to determine whether the House has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and whether, if true, these charges rise to the level of removing the President from office. The House had ample opportunity to pursue the answers to its inquiry in order to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. They chose not to do so. Instead, investigators followed an arbitrary, self-imposed timeline dictated by political, rather than substantive, concerns. When due process threatened to slow down the march forward, they took shortcuts. The Founding Fathers who crafted our modern impeachment mechanism predicted this moment, and warned against a solely partisan and politically-motivated process. They understood that an impeachment process rooted purely in disagreements about policy would subordinate the Executive to Congress, rather than delineating it as a co-equal branch of our federal government. Instead, they believed issues that do not meet the Constitutional threshold for impeachment should be navigated through our electoral process. To remove a U.S. President from office, for the first time in our history, on anything less than overwhelming evidence of `Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors' would effectively overturn the will of the American people. For these reasons, I voted to acquit the President on both articles of impeachment. It has been three years to the day since the Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act was signed into law and I'm incredibly proud that the ABLE to Work Act and the ABLE Financial Planning Act are included in the historic, soon-to-be passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These provisions will enhance the immensely popular ABLE Act by allowing disabled Americans the opportunity to work and save more money tax-free, without losing their needed benefits. They will also allow for savings in 529 college savings plans to be rolled over into ABLE accounts tax-free if an individual becomes disabled after a family has already started saving for college. Families and individuals with disabilities across the country will benefit tremendously from these provisions, and I'm pleased to see them included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that passed the House earlier today, and will soon pass the Senate. In Iraq we had Iraqi interpreters that served with U.S. troops, in Afghanistan the same. Many lost their lives or were injured. Out of the last five coalition battles around the world, only three countries have been at our side every step of the way. One was the United Arab Emirates. How do you tell the Bahrain pilots that fly, the Saudi pilots pilots that fly the Emirates pilots, you're good enough to fight against ISIL but not good enough to come in the United States. Huge mistake. I think that this sends the wrong message to people that have to be part of our partnership for a solution. And does serve as fuel -- I'm not concern not about international I'm concerned about radicalization here, from people who are already in the United States that does tend to fuel. After discovering the existence, if not the full scope, of Russia's election interference efforts in late-2016, the Obama Administration struggled to determine the appropriate response. Frozen by `paralysis of analysis,' hamstrung by constraints both real and perceived, Obama officials debated courses of action without truly taking one. Many of their concerns were understandable, including the fear that warning the public of the election threat would only alarm the American people and accomplish Russia's goal of undermining faith in our democratic institutions. In navigating those valid concerns, however, Obama officials made decisions that limited their options, including preventing internal information-sharing and siloing cyber and geopolitical threats, This funding is long overdue, and will help thousands of North Carolinian families and small businesses still recovering from the historic damage incurred by Hurricane Florence last fall. It also begins the process of rebuilding Camp Lejeune and other military bases, providing hundreds of millions of dollars for storm-related repairs. Much of the funding will go toward future prevention efforts and flood mitigation to make sure we are better prepared when the next storm hits. I appreciate the immense effort Senator Tillis, Governor Cooper, and the entire North Carolina delegation have dedicated throughout this process. I am committed to working with them as this funding and additional resources are made available in the months to come. Director Brennan's recent statements purport to know as fact that the Trump campaign colluded with a foreign power. If Director Brennan's statement is based on int"
Q6380211," Despite our best efforts, the threat of the Covid-19 virus continues to spread and, unfortunately, we have not yet reached peak impact. The decision to place regulations upon Alabamians living in Jefferson County and its surrounding counties was an effort to contain the area in which the virus has been prevalent in our state. As of this morning, 68 individuals have tested positive for the Coronavirus in Alabama. While I am pleased that many of our citizens are self-regulating and are practicing social distancing, we want to ensure that Alabama is doing our part to flatten the curve. Closing Alabama beaches is not a simple decision but one that I came to with the consultation of our elected officials along the coast and members of my administration. After many rounds of conversations with local leaders, in which we discussed several options, I have decided to close beach access in any form. Since we do not want to promote social gatherings, keeping the beaches open sends the wrong message to the public. At this moment, the safety and wellbeing of Alabamians is paramount. In addition, we rely heavily upon our first responders and critical healthcare workers to help those who are ill, as well as essential state government employees to keep the continuity of government, and many of them struggle with dependent childcare if daycares close. As a result, I have asked the Alabama Department of Human Resources and the Alabama Department of Public Health to explore emergency rule making to make critical exemptions to allow for daycare to be provided for these areas of crucial personnel. My administration -- and all the services of state government -- are going to be as flexible as humanly possible to help make your government work for you during the coming days and weeks. I want to the thank the people of our great state for their continued patience and for taking great care of themselves and each other during this pandemic. Today, I received the resignation of State Superintendent of Education Michael Sentance. I do not take this situation lightly, and as President of the State Board of Education, I will ask the Board to accept his resignation. Over the past two years, Alabama has experienced far too many changes in state government. As with previous changes in leadership positions, we will use the pending resignation of the state superintendent as an opportunity to move forward and begin a new chapter in public education. The State Board of Education has an opportunity to refocus its efforts to improve, support, and better prepare Alabama students for the 21st-Century global economy, so that they can compete successfully. Education continues to be the foundation of our communities and a key piece of the fabric that holds our state together -- now is the time to strengthen our education system. I have spoken with Mr. Sentance, thanked him for his commitment to public service and education, and wished him well. I am profoundly grateful for this good news. Naturally, I want to thank the Good Lord for His abundant grace in my healing. This is one more of the many blessings He has bestowed on my life. I am also incredibly grateful to my dedicated team of physicians who have been candid with me during this entire process. Alabama is home to world-renown researchers and innovators in medicine, and I am so very proud of the work they do in our state. Most of all, I want to thank the good people of our great state for your many prayers and continued support. As I travel throughout Alabama, I have been reminded at every stop that Alabamians are the most thoughtful and loving people one will ever meet. I have been humbled by your support during my recovery, and it is my life's highest honor to serve as your governor. As we start a New Year, I am both hopeful and excited that we can continue moving Alabama forward. May God continue to bless each of you and this great state we call home. I am deeply concerned by the charges the Judicial Inquiry Commission filed against Chief Justice Roy Moore. It is my understanding Alabama is the only state suspending a Judge while a complaint is considered by the Court of the Judiciary. The rule of law and due process are concepts fundamental to our legal system. I hope the Court of the Judiciary will act quickly. In this interim, I'm thankful that Alabama has public servants like Justice Lyn Stuart to keep our courts on track during this difficult time. Currently, there are clouds hanging over all three branches of state government. As a result, the World is watching -- all eyes are on the State of Alabama, for the wrong reasons. I continue to pray for our State and believe our best days are ahead of us -- I believe in Alabama, its people and the rule of law. I support Medicaid's shift in reform strategy, which has been fully shared with legislative leadership and other key stakeholders. I spoke with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, and he has assured me of the Trump administr"
Q1431761," As every honest observer knows, this is a shutdown that Senate Democrats chose to make happen. The House passed a bipartisan funding bill with nothing controversial in it. President Trump is ready to sign it. But because it doesn't contain an unrelated far-left demand, Democrats like Chuck Schumer and Bob Casey are abusing Senate rules to block it. By recklessly insisting that a short-term funding bill include a separate measure to give legal status to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, Senate Democrats are showing their true colors as a party on the fringe. They are literally putting the interests of non-citizens before the needs of millions of American children and troops. This kind of obstruction may please their liberal base, but it is wrong, radical, and dangerous. Senator Schumer was right back in 2013 when he said that `shutting down the government' over immigration reform `would be governmental chaos.' Five years later, he should reverse his stunning hypocrisy and lead his party to do the right thing for America. The future of the DACA program -- created only by an unconstitutional executive order -- deserves to be thoroughly debated in open hearings and careful discussion considering its dramatic size, scope, and ramifications. Rushing it through the process to jam it into a CR is just plain irresponsible. For now, it's time to end the Schumer Shutdown. I look forward to once again engaging with my constituents during this interactive event and hearing their concerns about the important issues facing our country. This completely free and fully accessible format will allow thousands of individuals to share their views and get answers without having to travel anywhere. Last quarter's hugely successful event attracted more than 6,000 participants from all seven counties and covered every topic on their minds -- local, national, and international.

This proven format is all about providing the most convenient service to every Third District resident who wishes to engage in a constructive community discussion without any unnecessary distractions or disruptions. I am very grateful that so many prominent organizations are strongly supporting this bipartisan bill to make retirement saving easier and more accessible. Far too many Americans face challenges in saving for their future because they don't have access to a private sector workplace retirement plan. To ensure full financial security during their golden years, Americans should have multiple sources of retirement income -- including Social Security, personal savings, and employer-sponsored savings plans. RESA would expand opportunities for workers to save through workplace retirement plans and go a long way toward helping families overcome the obstacles they face in properly preparing for their future. This is about helping every American enjoy full retirement security and peace of mind in the years when they deserve it most. There was a steady stream of Democrats coming down to the microphone and constantly berating automobile dealers and automobile people that I know so well, love so well and have worked with for so long. This is absolutely preposterous. Again, it's about dividing us as Americans, not about uniting us. And when we go to saying it's white vs. nonwhite, it's man vs. woman. That is so preposterous. And those are the type of things that divide us as a people. So, it's appalling for me to sit and watch that I will tell you this: if people think it's okay to sit back and not say anything when you know it's not true, when you know it's an outright lie, when you know it's an outright attempt to divide us and say nothing, that is not being a standup American. Have you got to stand up for all Americans, by the way.

Q16221742," Today, the House passed the Conference Report on the National Defense Authorization Act, a critically-important piece of legislation that funds the military of the United States. Under the NDAA, the men and women who serve our great nation will receive their largest pay raise in nine years. Each Service receives a larger budget, addressing critical issues of military readiness, training, safety, and more. The NDAA takes a clear-eyed look at the challenges and threats facing America and gives the Department of Defense the resources it needs to tackle them. It addresses the perils of Chinese technology theft, closes dangerous loopholes in foreign investments, and enhances our missile defense -- all while curbing bureaucracy and increasing accountability to ensure that Americans' tax dollars are well-spent. This bill is a victory for Northwest Florida, with a $31.9 million increase in funding for test ranges like the Gulf Test Range, as well as construction of new buildings at Eglin AFB and a new air control tower at Whiting Field. The NDAA further cements Northwest Florida's reputation as America's premiere location for military training. A strong military makes a strong nation, and with the passage of the NDAA, our military is continuing to be rebuilt after many years of hardship and neglect. I was proud to vote for the NDAA, and glad that so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle supported it, too. I have every confidence that the Senate will pass it quickly. Our highest priority in Congress is to ensure the defense of America. By passing the NDAA, we have done just that, I think there is an agreement to be had but, Sue, this wasn't an election about DACA. If this was an election about DACA, Hillary Clinton would have won it. Donald Trump won this election because it was about border security, so I'm trying to focus the Congress on the very good measures that have passed out of the Judiciary Commitee: E-verify, ending chain migration, ensuring that we don't have a Visa lottery system that stands in the place of a true merit-based system that would bring the best and brightest to the United States of America. So there are good, bi-partisan ideas, unfortunately, Democrats have seized on this comment by the president behind closed doors as a basis to stop negotiating. I think the Democrats don't really want a solution here, if they did, we could forge one but this is too valuable politically for too many Congressional Democrats, they want to keep the controversy alive rather than actually passing legislation that deals with DACA at the same time as securing our border and ending the flawed immigration system that so many Americans rejected in this last election by voting for Donald Trump, I certainly don't want to see the government shut down, but it's deeply frustrating to me that a year into the Republican control of the Congress, we continue with Continuing Resolutions. And for folks watching at home, when you hear that Congress is voting for for a continuing resolution, that's to keep doing things the same way: keep funding Obamacare, keep funding Planned Parenthood, keep funding entitlements for illegal aliens. I don't wan na keep doing things the same way, I wan na do things differently, and that's why I voted against every continuing resolution. That said, we're gon na do everything we can to avoid a shutdown in the government. We know the impact that that has on Northwest Florida families, so many of whom have employment tied to the federal government, so hopefully, we'll be able to reach a solution that sets us on a path to more fiscal responsibility and doesn't just blindly vote to keep doing things the same way, This cruel plan is repugnant to the 10th Amendment and harms some of our most vulnerable fellow Americans. In my district and nationwide, children have been helped by medical marijuana when all other treatments have failed... (Attorney General) Sessions' policy would make sick children sicker. It would oppose the will of 81 percent of veterans, according to the American Legion. It will place the government between vulnerable people and something that could help them. This decision even flies in the face of President Trump, who expressed support for medical marijuana and state-level decision-making during his campaign, and stated July 29, 2016, that `I think it should be up to the states.' While prosecution of bad actors is always welcome, it would be heartless to systemically use the awesome power of the federal government to punish people providing legitimate medicine. Look, the timeline is what it is, right? The fact that Mueller after getting rejected for getting his own job back and picks Andrew Weissman to be his number two, and you are saying he couldn't pick somebody that didn't attend the Hillary Clinton election party, and the conflicts of interests abound. This is not an opinion, it's action, Chris. You have Weissman sending an e-mail on his doj account praising somebody"
Q28113710," President Trump is proposing an appropriate response to China's recent threat of new tariffs. After a detailed investigation, USTR found overwhelming evidence that China's unreasonable actions are harming the US economy. In the light of such evidence, the appropriate response from China should be to change its behavior, as China's government has pledged to do many times. Economies around the world, including China's own, would benefit if China would implement policies that truly reward hard work and innovation, rather than continuing its policies that distort the vital high-tech sector. Unfortunately, China has chosen to respond thus far with threats to impose unjustified tariffs on billions of dollars in US exports, including our agricultural products. Such measures would undoubtedly cause further harm to American workers, farmers, and businesses. Under these circumstances, the President is right to ask for additional appropriate action to obtain the elimination of the unfair acts, policies, and practices identified in USTR's report. We're not starting a trade war at all. We have exactly the same objective as the Chamber of Commerce, exactly the same objective. The question is how do we get there? We've tried it their way for 25 years. Since at least 1995, we tried it their way. All I am saying is let's try a different route for a little bit. The result of their way, I would suggest, is a $750 billion goods deficit, and an overall goods and services deficit of $500 billion. I mean, these are staggering numbers. We ought to try something else. I think we're going to end up with more efficiency. We're going to end up with more global wealth. it's going to be fine for businesses, but most importantly, it's going to be fine for American workers and American farmers who need a break. And part of this whole trade idea, this whole public contract is that we give fair trade in return for open markets, and that's what all the workers bought into. And until now they really haven't got it, but with this president, I think they're going to get it. introductory speech made it clear that the Trump administration is mired in an outdated, mercantilist win-lose strategy. This is likely not salable, and pushing it too far could jeopardize the livelihoods of tens of millions of American farmers, ranchers and manufacturers on the cutting edge and their workers. Trust and respect are essential in trade negotiations. It is difficult to muster trust when the one doing the demanding is not prepared to discuss those demands, or consider trade-offs to achieve them. Asking for clarification is not obstructionist. It's what negotiations are about. This is a negotiation, after all. Trust will be difficult to develop as long as negotiations are mired in a swamp of uncertainty. Successful negotiations reflect a balance of rights and obligations. NAFTA is a good example. Lighthizer is trying to rebalance NAFTA by enhancing U.S. rights and increasing Canadian and Mexican obligations. It's a very, very serious challenge, not just to us, but to Europe, Japan, and the global trading system. And basically, it's very focused. It is the areas you talked about, but also aerospace, on new energy vehicles. I mean, they want to be on top of all the high tech, all the cutting-edge economic areas. and it's smart for them to do it. I mean, they're doing something that's in their interest and that they should do. We should be in a position to defend ourselves with the same amount of vigor. And I think that this president will do that. But that is a genuine threat. It's a combination of massive subsidies, of closed markets, and of focus on technology transfer. So, it's a very, very serious threat in all of those areas, and if you go through the parts of our economy that are affected by it, it's hard to find any kind of a tech part that's not potentially adversely affected by this. Canada is acting against its own workers' and businesses' interests. Even if Canada succeeded on these groundless claims, other countries would primarily benefit, not Canada. For example, if the US removed the orders listed in Canada's complaint, the flood of imports from China and other countries would negatively impact billions of dollars in Canadian exports to the United States, including nearly $9bn in exports of steel and aluminum products and more than $2.5 bn in exports of wood and paper products. Canada's claims threaten the ability of all countries to defend their workers against unfair trade. Canada's complaint is bad for Canada. President Trump has made it clear we must insist on fair and reciprocal trade with China and strictly enforce our laws against unfair trade. This requires taking effective action to confront China over its state-led efforts to force, strong-arm, and even steal U.S. technology and intellectual property. Years of talking about these problems with China has not worked. The United States is committed to using all available tools to respond to C"
Q6106781," With two-thirds gone, we still have about two-thirds of the work left to do. The big things that are going to come up are going to be the budget. That's an important thing that has to happen. We've got to be able to control our spending to be able to get back into balance and set ourselves up for that long-term tax relief. Another priority is going to be this tax package that has come out, making sure we get the tax reform for Nebraska families. We've also got some good government bills in here that will help us combine different agencies to get more efficiencies, some things to cut the regulatory red tape around occupational licenses. So, there's a lot of things left in this next third of the session left, the next 28 days or so that we've got to get done. It's a lot of work, but I'm confident the Legislature will pull it together, During our conversations over the past several weeks, ConAgra's CEO Sean Connolly told me that any changes made in Nebraska would be a part of a larger restructuring of the company to improve their operations. While I regret ConAgra's decision, it is a reminder why we must continually look for new ways to ensure our tax rates and incentive programs remain competitive and it is also why I have dedicated two trade missions to highlighting investment opportunities in our state. As ConAgra continues to plan for their future, we will continue to support the 1,200 ConAgra jobs that will remain in Omaha as their leadership works to turn the company around. The Governor's Office and the Nebraska Department of Labor stand ready to assist Nebraskans seeking reemployment due to ConAgra's restructuring. The next several weeks will be key to slowing the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in Nebraska. The virus is expected to peak in Nebraska during the next month. We can expect more recorded cases as testing expands, and additional deaths as we approach this peak period. As we wage war against the virus, we are asking Nebraskans to further limit social interactions. Everyone should work, go home, and shop once a week. We all need to stay home whenever possible, stay healthy, and stay connected. Each one of us has to take personal responsibility for adhering to social distancing rules. Stay six feet away from other people. Do not gather in groups of more than ten people. By working together, we can flatten the curve and slow the spread of the virus. The Legislature and I worked together to create the Developing Youth Talent Initiative (DYTI) in 2015. The program helps expose middle school students in the 7th and 8th grades to great opportunities in manufacturing and information technology fields. Over the past few years, we have seen businesses team up with 23 school districts to serve at least 7,000 students, and we are adding new programs every year. This has helped increase interest at the high school level. Hastings Public schools have seen a 15 percent increase in the number of students who enroll in skills and technical sciences courses after participating in a full year of DYTI programming, We also have to look into that environment as well regarding privileges and how are we treating people. This is actually one of the problems we have had with the Legislature when they passed LB 598 which was in regards on how to segregate those people that are causing problems. They gave us very little time to write those regulations. When I talked to to the corrections office yesterday that was one of the areas of concern. In communication with Director (Scott) Frakes, these kinds of regulations take years and get the input of staff on how they should be written and the Legislature didn't give us the time to get that done. The seed company is the beneficiary of the work performed by the H-2A worker, but they are not the employer of the H-2A worker. The contracted harvest company often comes in from other states. The employer from out of state does not have the networking connections or known reputation to find available Nebraska workers. Meanwhile, there are Nebraska harvest companies that have the workers available to perform the work. In 2019, Nebraska detasseling (harvest) companies had 710 employees wait listed, but certifications were still granted for H-2A workers to perform detasseling. We have accomplished a lot in the last 4 years, we've really taken what I've learned in business and applied it to making government more affective, more efficient, more customer service. So while we've got a number of areas where we've made great improvements like children family services, our behavioral health, development disabilities, how we're doing economic development we lead the nation in economic development we've got more work to do. There's more work that we can do to do a better job serving the people of Nebraska and that's what i'm looking forward to doing, is not just a slogan. And it's not just about abortion. It's an important part of what we do... but it's also remembering that we've got p"
Q1415243," I was sworn into this position on February 10, and shortly thereafter we had the tribal advisory council that met in Washington. It was with tribal leaders from all over the nation, and the Indian Health Service is within the Department of Health and Human Services, and so what I was impressed with in the tribal advisory council is the commitment, the sincerity, the drive, the openness and the candor with which they express the challenges that exist in tribal territory. The trust responsibility relationship that is so important between the United States government and tribal governments, and then when you look at the health status and the health outcomes that vary remarkably across tribal territory, being a Georgian and having represented a district from Georgia before I got this position -- where there are no tribes -- I had no foundation upon which to draw about the challenges that exist, and so I said to my folks, `I've got to get out there and see the tribal territory, especially the healthcare aspect of the tribal territory. ' Many of our friends here on this floor have asked about budgets being moral documents, and they are. Let me ask, Madam Chair: Where is the morality in trapping disadvantaged people in a web of welfare programs that discourage self-sufficiency and, instead, shackle them to government dependency? Where is the morality, Madam Chair, in committing retirees to a health coverage program that is going bankrupt and that can't keep its promises if its so-called protectors keep blocking reform? Where is the morality, Madam Chair, in forcing low-income people into second rate health programs in which many can't get appointments and in which doctors are grossly under-reimbursed by the government? Where is the morality, Madam Chair, in tying college students to years of crippling debt because of a government-run loan program that drives up tuition? Where is the morality in heaping trillions of dollars of debt onto future generations to finance today's government spending because today's policymakers refuse to stop overspending? I think what the important point here is that, all of these trips were official business. All of them were within budget. All of them were approved by the normal processes that every other administration has gone through, prior to the trip, not after. But we've heard the concerns. I've heard the concerns. I've heard the criticisms. And, in order to make certain that people appreciate that my respect for the taxpayer is as strong as it can be and always has been in my 40-year career, we think it's important to do a number of things. One is to say there will be no private air charters at HHS going forward. Second, is to cooperate fully, obviously, with the inspector general. There's a review going on, and that I called for an internal review within the department itself. And then finally, to pay for my portion of those trips. This is unprecedented, never been done, to our understanding, before by a secretary, in spite of the fact that previous administrations had secretaries that flew an awful lot. The mission of HHS is to improve the health and safety and well-being of the American people, and right now, across the country, there are many individuals who have a challenge from healthcare access and cost of insurance in the individual and small group market and that's what we want to focus on. And there are literally millions of folks who... either aren't able to afford their insurance or pay a premium. Premiums are up 25 percent over the last year, almost... 100 percent over the last three to four years. So, what we want to make certain is that we are being true to the principles of healthcare, which is a system that is accessible for everybody and affordable for everybody and of the highest quality, making sure we incentivize innovation and empowering patients through both transparency and accountability. So, that's the plan we've been working on, and we look forward to moving it very, very soon. Lightest hairdryer I've ever encountered. My boyfriend and I both use this and it's worth the money we paid. I have thick, medium-length hair (past my shoulders) and with my old hair dryer -- or any I've used -- it would take me close to an hour to get my hair dry. By that point, my arms are hurting and my hair is a lion's main and I just didn't have the energy to even get myself ready after the hassle. BUT with this BaBylissPro, I got my hair dryer in 15 -- 20 mins. That's me taking my time, parting sections and using my round boar brush. This dryer is amazing. Even air flow, quiet, and simple settings. I'd recommend this so any friend and even you who is reading this now. Update: Over a year later it still works just like the first day we used it. We use it every day! It's been knocked off the counter by hips or our cats and still solid and light and still amazing! These grants aim to increase access to treatment, reduce unmet need, and reduce overdose related deaths. I unde"
Q11171," State's practice was to disfavor the religious basis of [ Phillips' ] objection. Despite ruling in favor of the cake owner, however, the majority went out of its way to explain that another case posing the same constitutional question, but without the religious hostility highlighted here, could easily come out the other way: In this case the adjudication concerned a context that may well be different going forward in the respects noted above. However later cases raising these or similar concerns are resolved in the future, for these reasons the rulings of the Commission and of the state court that enforced the Commission's order must be invalidated. The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts, all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market. Masterpiece Cakeshop forced a contentious constitutional question onto a central faultline in our culturally fractured democracy: where a state law prohibits discrimination, does the First Amendment shield business owners who have religious objections to same-sex marriage from having to provide services that contribute to the celebration of a same-sex wedding? After today's ruling, the question remains unresolved. What is clear from the decision is summed up well by the Baptist Joint Committee's Holly Hollman, who issued a statement following the ruling that said, in part: Religious liberty protects beliefs and actions related to marriage. It does not mean that religious beliefs provide blanket exemptions to nondiscrimination laws that protect our neighbors. Religious objectors, like all Americans, have the right to be treated with respect and not to have their religious beliefs denigrated. As we consider these difficult issues in future cases, we all will fare better when we acknowledge the legitimate interests on both sides of these disputes and approach each other with civility and respect. In Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783, the Court found no First Amendment violation in the Nebraska Legislature's practice of opening its sessions with a prayer delivered by a chaplain paid from state funds. The decision concluded that legislative prayer, while religious in nature, has long been understood as compatible with the Establishment Clause. As practiced by Congress since the framing of the Constitution, legislative prayer lends gravity to public business, reminds lawmakers to transcend petty differences in pursuit of a higher purpose, and expresses a common aspiration to a just and peaceful society.... Legislative invocations are compatible with the Establishment Clause. The First Congress made it an early item of business to appoint and pay official chaplains, and both the House and Senate have maintained the office virtually uninterrupted since that time.... That the First Congress provided for the appointment of chaplains only days after approving language for the First Amendment demonstrates that the Framers considered legislative prayer a benign acknowledgment of religion's role in society.... In the 1850's, the judiciary committees in both the House and Senate reevaluated the practice of official chaplaincies after receiving petitions to abolish the office. The committees concluded that the office posed no threat of an establishment.... The Court instructed that the `content of the prayer is not of concern to judges.' ... To hold that invocations must be nonsectarian would force the legislatures that sponsor prayers and the courts that are asked to decide these cases to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech, a rule that would involve government in religious matters to a far greater degree than is the case under the town's current practice of neither editing or approving prayers in advance nor criticizing their content after the fact.... It would be but a few steps removed from that prohibition for legislatures to require chaplains to redact the religious content from their message in order to make it acceptable for the public sphere. Government may not mandate a civic religion that stifles any but the most generic reference to the sacred any more than it may prescribe a religious orthodoxy.... See Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 590 (1992) (`The suggestion that government may establish an official or civic religion as a means of avoiding the establishment of a religion with more specific creeds strikes us as a contradiction that cannot be accepted' ); Schempp, 374 U. S., at 306 (Goldberg, J., concurring) (arguing that `untutored devotion to the concept of neutrality' must not lead to `a brooding and pervasive devotion to the secular' ).... The First Amendment is not a majority rule, and government may not seek to define permissible categories of religious speech.... While these prayers vary in their degree of"
Q23016975," The results of the 2018-19 ILEARN proficiency test are scheduled to be released next week. The results will show a decrease compared to the previously administered ISTEP + test. Since this is the first year of the ILEARN assessment, I will ask Superintendent McCormick to support my request that the General Assembly take action to hold schools harmless so the test scores do not have an adverse impact on teacher evaluations and schools' letter grades for the 2018-19 school year. This action will ease the transition to ILEARN, which is a student assessment that allows Indiana to comply with federal ESSA requirements. I appreciate the dedicated work of Hoosier educators. Bringing consistency and continuity to how we measure student progress and preparing students for post-secondary success is a shared and important goal. Applicable law and opinions guide me to direct the Excise Police to perform normal, periodic regulatory spot checks of CBD oil products, focusing on those products which contain any level of THC. Because CBD oil has been sold in Indiana for several years, the excise police will use the next 60 days to educate, inform and issue warnings to retailers so there is a reasonable period of time for them to remove products that contain THC. In the meantime, the General Assembly will have the opportunity to review existing CBD oil laws, as well as labeling requirements, while no confiscation of products occurs. The legislation I signed in the spring continues to help protect Hoosiers struggling with epilepsy who use CBD oil products for treatment, provided they register with the Indiana State Department of Health. This report card makes clear our state's strengths and challenges: Indiana is a top state for doing business, but to meet the demands of our growing economy we must double-down on efforts to attract and prepare a ready workforce. There is no single solution for improvement. The only way we'll take our state to the next level is with a comprehensive strategy, and Indiana has the right roadmap. From improving roads and bridges to attacking the drug epidemic, from prekindergarten to adult career training, from more direct flights to enhanced regional development -- all of these efforts combined will help build healthier, more vibrant communities that are magnets for jobs and growth. Now is the time for our state's leaders to come together and put in the hard work that will improve the lives of Hoosiers. Indiana has never been more focused on helping people obtain the skills they need to secure good jobs that fuel our state's growing economy. Expanding the reach of federal Pell programs will help support education for incarcerated Hoosiers, adult learners, and high school students to help them obtain a quality credential beyond a high school diploma. This will go a long way in helping Indiana meet its goal for at least 60 percent of Hoosiers to have education and training beyond high school by 2025 -- a goal directly aligned to future workforce needs. These federal changes recognize that states need more flexibility to target support to their unique populations, meet current workforce needs, and prepare for a rapidly changing future workforce and economy. I know this bill bugged some of my legislative friends, but the truth is it's a big deal to young students around the state who have reached out to us in support -- particularly students from Cumberland Elementary School in West Lafayette. They've shown incredible perseverance and have advocated for the Say's Firefly to be the official state insect for several years. Beyond the satisfaction these kids will feel when they look out on a hot Indiana summer night and see the state insect flashing away, the real beauty of this bill is the civic engagement it inspired in our youngest citizens. It's taught them a great deal about how our lawmaking process works -- and that if they are engaged, they can make a real difference. We're dealing with what is coming our way in making sure that we're combating it step by step. It used to be that, at least for me, folks were a little reluctant to talk about it. But today we're dealing with it. We're dealing with it very effectively at every level of government. This is a mission that we are all united on. From start to finish at the legislative session we never lost sight of what we needed to do. Establishing again from the local community to your statehouse to your congressional delegation here in the state of Indiana all the way to the White House, we're all now working hand in glove to make sure we're not spilling these precious resources that need to get to these precious lives. Governor Holcomb understands the critical role the tech sector plays in the state's economy and has taken bold action to help it thrive. Trailblazers are among the state's most inspiring and influential players. They are innovative risk-takers whose achievements and bold leadership are catalysts for tech growth and success. Governor"
Q861999," An amendment added to the American Health Care Act, which House Republicans narrowly passed Thursday, would allow states to obtain a waiver so they could charge customers with preexisting conditions more than other people. The latest addition, which would provide $8 billion over five years to lower premiums for those with preexisting conditions, swayed concerned lawmakers to support the bill, allowing House Republicans to secure enough votes to pass it. Democrats, however, say the $8 billion is not enough and that those with preexisting conditions will face the choice of paying exorbitant premiums or carrying no insurance. Cassidy and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, had introduced the Patient Freedom Act, which would create larger risk pools to keep costs down for those with serious health problems. The bill also would repeal Obamacare mandates that require individuals and business owners to buy insurance and shift health-care decisions to the states. Under the bill, states would also have the option to keep the plan they have in place today. Under the plan, known as the Patient Freedom Act, state legislatures would have the choice of whether to keep Obamacare operating in their states, complete with its subsidies, mandates and protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Other states, the senators say, could opt into an alternative plan that would provide a uniform tax credit linked to a health savings account to help people afford a basic, less comprehensive health insurance plan. The lawmakers hope the ability of blue states to keep Obamacare could help bring Democratic senators on board and get to the required 60 votes in the Senate for a replacement plan. `At some point in this process, we're going to need a bill that can get 60 votes,' Cassidy said at a press conference Monday.' We think that helps us get to 60. ' Taking funding away from Louisiana's coastline is a nonstarter. Our state's future depends on this funding to rebuild our coastline. However, this budget is a guideline; Congress must now hold hearings and do the necessary work to ensure the bill protects American taxpayers and families. There are deal breakers for me in the current budget. For one, this budget fails to prioritize restoring Louisiana's eroding coasts. This is a national issue -- restoring Louisiana's coasts ensures our state can continue to produce energy needed by our entire nation. Any cuts to coastal restoration efforts or GOMESA are short-sighted. As the committee process moves forward, I will not only oppose cuts to the revenue sharing program but continue to work to expand it for the gulf coast, President Trump presented an optimistic vision for our country. With our tax cuts legislation already delivering bigger paychecks and better benefits for workers and families, I look forward to working with the president to expand America's energy dominance, restore respect for the Constitution throughout the judiciary, and make our military second to none. As a doctor, I especially appreciate his desire to address out-of-control prescription drug costs and the need for a more open, transparent healthcare system. The president also discussed several issues where I believe we can find bipartisan agreement, including modernizing our nation's infrastructure, improving border security, combating the opioid epidemic, and taking care of our veterans. If Dr. Gee had called and asked how this bill would impact Louisiana, she could have been walked through as to why her concerns are unfounded. Instead, she chose to echo a left wing think tank which is working to preserve Obamacare. On the other hand, on one thing, the letter is correct. Our proposal spends less money than Obamacare. We eliminate the penalties paid by individuals and business which do not conform to Obamacare mandates. If Dr. Gee thinks that more money is needed, she should suggest that these taxes be re-imposed on state level. For the record, I oppose this as 58% of individual mandate penalties are paid by families earning less than $50,000 per year. I think these families should be helped, not penalized. The 21st Century Cures Act marks a giant step forward in fixing our broken mental health system. It institutes comprehensive mental health care reform and makes resources available to the millions that have been previously denied treatment due to a lack of access. I want to thank all those who helped make mental health a priority in Congress, but I especially thank my colleague Senator Chris Murphy. We have been working together to fix our country's broken mental health system since day one. Without him and the bipartisan effort he has brought to this legislation, we would not be here today. I urge the President to sign this bill and help the millions of individuals and families affected by mental health become whole, Dear Reverend Kastler: Thank you for expressing your thoughts on Senator Lee's amendment to require women to be registered for the draft. It's good"
