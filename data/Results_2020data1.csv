Q473239,"And they are working towards delivering their team to the ultimate negotiations. I've said that consistently.... I've watched my life take turns that one would never have expected. But it's not something I want to do. We don't know exactly which day it would've been executed. But it was very clear: Qassim Suleimani himself was plotting a broad, large-scale attack against American interests. And those attacks were imminent. We've seen just these last six days a significant reduction in violence in Afghanistan, We discussed ways, too, to further improve the business climate, strengthen the rule of law, and provide sustainable economic opportunities for all citizens all across Uzbekistan. We want private investment, American private investment sector, to flow between our two nations. As @Khamenei_ir (Khamenei) knows, the best biological defense would've been to tell the Iranian people the truth about the Wuhan virus when it spread to #Iran from China. Instead, he kept Mahan Air flights coming and going to the epicenter in China and jailed those who spoke out. This action increases pressure on Maduro to negotiate seriously and open a path out of the crisis through a transitional government that will lead to free and fair presidential elections, Americans abroad face unprecedented challenges enriched to a higher level than they did when we took office. I am pleased that the UK and EU have agreed on a Brexit deal that honours the will of the British people.

[ t ] he United States is not a party to the ICC, and we will take all necessary measures to protect our citizens from this renegade, unlawful, so-called court. This is yet another reminder of what happens when multilateral bodies lack oversight and responsible leadership and become instead a vehicle for political vendettas.

We laid down the 12 things that we asked Iran to do, They're burning posters and billboards with Soleimani's face on them, and chanting `Soleimani is a murderer.'

We have developed a strategy to convince the Iranian regime to behave like a normal nation. That's what our strategy is about. We've been executing it. I think the Iranian leadership understands that President Trump will take action. We've made this clear for months. When I was the CIA director, we made very clear that these responses would be swift and decisive.

Lisa and I are sending our thoughts to his colleagues and family, So we're trying to shift the supplies to really isolate that and do contract tracing, but we don't even have enough supplies to do the testing, Ensuring that small businesses in Montana have access to capital and resources that will allow them to weather temporary closures and bounce back from critical quarantine efforts is paramount to my administration. Our long-term growth is best helped by guaranteeing the health and safety of our workers and their families during this crisis. To rebuild our economic strength, we must do everything we can to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in Montana. We felt as a family that there is something that is bigger and greater than the five of us need right now, The time to act is really now before the spread of infections gets worse, Thank you for your support as we work together to respond to the challenges of this health crisis. outdoor recreation activities that pose enhanced risk of injury or could otherwise stress the ability of local responders to address the COVID-19 emergency, I don't think it would be wise or serve the best interest of Montanans at this time to make decisions that will have finality for what Montana might look like eight or 10 weeks down the road. Visitors are not only concentrating in the Park but are also straining local grocery and other facilities at a time when local officials are attempting to curtail gatherings and meet the need for essential services. Communities that invest in modern infrastructure, including drinking water and wastewater treatment systems, benefit now and for generations to come, I am taking these measures today because we need to stay in front of this pandemic and slow the growth of infections. In order to have a healthy economy, we need a healthy population. We cannot rebuild our economic strength without doing everything we can now to flatten the curve and slow the spread of this virus.

Our service members and their families already sacrifice so much, and Ian took his call of duty even further to help those in need across the world. everything we can to cut off the chain of transmission. These projects not only create good-paying jobs for Montana workers, they better prepare our communities for new growth and development to enhance the health and well-being of our citizens, and protect our soil, groundwater and surface water. It's much better to see the person and to do what we can visually and to interact more so than a telephone call, Such an approach will reduce the overall number of infections in the state and preserve increasingly scarce health-care resources, I said to someone, `I think, like most Montanans, I'm over this; I wish the virus was, and the virus isn't over this, I think it's been hard in the last three (campaigns) for our children to witness what has been published and what has been said about their father.

California taxpayers are taking a stand against bigotry and in support of those who would be harmed by this prejudiced policy, As Texas and the Trump Administration fight to disrupt our healthcare system and the coverage that millions rely upon, we look forward to making our case in defense of the ACA. American lives depend upon it, I appreciate the opportunity to share information on what the state of California has done to combat the problem as well as on the challenges that lie ahead as unscrupulous lenders attempt to evade the consumer protections offered by state usury law, We have a responsibility to ensure that the rights of pollution-burdened communities are respected, We have a responsibility to our communities, particularly those that are disproportionately affected by pollution, to make sure all feasible mitigation measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in projects like the World Logistics Center. Local governments like Moreno Valley must do their part as regulators if we are going to safeguard the well-being of residents and meet California's long-term climate change goals. Inexcusable is the only way to describe the FDIC's utter lack of concern for vulnerable communities targeted by predatory lenders. We recently adopted new rate caps in California to protect consumers. The federal government should be looking to do the same -- not creating loopholes that benefit shady actors. It should be no different when we get to the Supreme Court with most of these cases, Women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect everywhere. There is no excuse for this kind of alleged behavior. It's not OK on the street, it's not OK in our schools and it's certainly not welcome at the airport.

To think that we're going to cut back on Air Guard improvements for our national defense is unacceptable. We've got to keep America safe. Speculating on how this started, where it started and where there were politics involved in it, leave that to the historians. At this moment, we want American families to feel safe and feel that we're doing everything within our power. The first thing I want is to make sure we have the test kits out and available. I think he has probably reached the point where he has fewer than four who will vote for the motion for witnesses and believes that he ultimately has all the votes he needs to exonerate this president, Fourteen years, it didn't make sense. To some people that's money they desperately need, The fact that they are wealthy in and of itself shouldn't disqualify them, but it doesn't qualify them for office, either, I'm glad the Senate came together on a bipartisan basis to unanimously pass this bill, which will help families in Illinois and across the country. We've got to keep America safe, It's way too early to project a number Senators will now have a chance to go on the record: Are you with the students or the predatory industry that defrauded them with worthless degrees and a lifetime of debt? the most painful situation we currently face for voting. There is a glimmer of hope that this might just turn out to be a trial. So far, it's not even close, This Congress, already afraid to stand up to many of President Trump's worst instincts, must not do so in a march to another war in the Middle East. As such, I urge my colleagues here to do our job and reaffirm the Senate's constitutional role in matters of war. I don't think you can answer that nine months, 10 months away from the election, There was a time when physical presence was the only way to make sure that a person was present and voting, testing process is apparently coming to a stop, There have been a few [ defections ], you know. But it really is a limited number. What we're trying to do is to make sure that's it's not just one and done. That you get this nice check, and you're finished. (We want to) make sure that if you're in a predicament where you've lost a job, that you are going to have continuity in your compensation over the next several months or more. That glimmer of hope that I had a few days ago disappeared last night with Lamar Alexander's decision, No, you'll find him in prison, serving a life sentence without parole plus 30 years. He broke the law by doing exactly what Sen. Sasse is describing. He's in prison, and as far as I'm concerned, should be. I don't see the fourth vote that's necessary.

This idea of bargaining, well we'll give you one irrelevant witness for one relevant witness, bologna, to cover expenses related to the disruption of campus operations, including things like course materials and technology, food, housing, health care, and childcare. He brought us to the brink of war with Iran. He continues to sow deep divisions by inciting violence, hate, and mistrust in our democracy. He has put Dreamers on notice for deportation. He continues to threaten health care for millions of people with pre-existing conditions. He diverts money from our service members and their families in order to build his big, beautiful wall time and time again. And he put his own personal, political gain ahead of that of the country that he is sworn to `preserve, protect, and defend.' America is better than the state of our union under President Trump. I think the Democratic caucus in Iowa is a quirky, quaint tradition which should come to an end. As we try to make voting easier for people across America, the Iowa caucus is the most painful situation we currently face for voting. determination to get this done if we can as quickly as possible.

If he vetoes this bill, we will be there. But, more importantly, the American people will be there. They will be there to support him. Let's build the wall and make sure that we do our job in Congress. I can tell you I probably get to talk to the president more than most members of Congress. This leak was designed for one purpose and one purpose only, and that was to try to manipulate the thinking of my Republican colleagues in the Senate to encourage them to open it up and provide for more witnesses... I also know the false narrative and the corrupt foundation that the House impeachment managers are trying to spin right now, but I do want to compliment my Senate colleagues. I've been on the floor there. They're taking notes, [ C ] an you imagine what this president could have accomplished if everyone -- they were in the boat rowing the same way -- but we've got people that are trying to turn the canoes over, turn the boats over and they're within the West Wing. It's not even just in part of D.C., it's at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Excellent address from @realDonaldTrump, That's in the long history of Michael Avenatti and Michael Cohen. I mean, come on. it is a circus. the American people know it, It gives them no flexibility, it gives them no additional cash flow, Meadows is currently considering several candidates for the press secretary job, including Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany, So we're going to rotate. cause grave harm to this year's census and could jeopardize a complete and accurate count. My Democratic colleagues, they sat on their hands last time, even when there wasn't an impeachment, He's been actively involved already, So you can be responsible but not necessarily putting forth the command. It is one crisis after another, Bravo to the President's legal team. Bravo. They were tremendous this week. This whole Russia investigation, I have been involved in that more than any member of Congress and I can tell you that there were a whole lot of things that my Democratic colleagues should be looking at, [ but ] they look the other way, On defending our civil liberties; on defending our Fourth Amendment rights, and it is that right to privacy. I think the troubling thing for many of us is actually staying alert enough to be able to follow it, I'd like to know, in terms of protected bike lanes, whether in other communities they allow electric scooters and other means of transportation to utilize those as well. Not necessarily Vespa scooters, but certainly electric type of movements, I just think at the same time it's hard to imagine Hunter Biden getting a good gig like that without some reason for that selection. Selective leaks designed to create a narrative that ultimately will change the conversation ultimately does not change the facts. We are going to continue to hear allegations of `cover-up.' The only `cover-up' that I've seen is actually Adam Schiff and his team's cover-up on their coordination with the whistleblower. We've already had Democrats come across and join with Republicans when it came to the impeachment articles in the House, I think, based on the president's speech today... I would say I'm optimistic that we can look at deescalating environment, Well, I'm still a member of Congress. He, with Secretary Azar, have been really engaged for weeks. It's just not the way our Constitution is set up. wants her to focus on defending the president on television. Pam Bondi is on the Senate floor nailing Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, and the Obama White House for their role in/handling of Ukrainian corruption, So, we are going to continue to hear allegations of [ a ] `cover-up.' The only `cover-up' that I've seen is actually Adam Schiff and his team's cover-up on their coordination with the whistleblower, He's repeatedly downplayed blatant FISA abuse in the past and dismissed the damning IG report's findings. How can he fix a problem he doesn't even understand? Completely unacceptable choice. If we're going to have a major deployment in Iran -- which we're not going to have -- then it would be appropriate, Certainly having it removed would be appropriate, Why did this leak out, at this time, Hardly groundbreaking or relevant, I don't agree with Lindsey Graham's analysis that they're doing a good job, with a debacle that started in Iowa in the acquittal on impeachment. My hypothesis is that this is part of a coordinated leak in order to change the narrative. Mick is smart, principled, and as tough a fighter you'll find in Washington, D.C..

Q1525924,"There's plenty to talk about and it's an opportunity to move on, There are other places where people have to work -- law enforcement, firefighters, first responders, people in hospitals, people in food processing facilities. There's a broad spectrum of economic challenges here in trying to be sure that the ones that have to function continue to function really is a priority, We sent a letter to prevent what we thought was a short-sighted and ill-thought-out policy, which goes from regional allocation to nationwide allocation, is all over but the shouting. After the historic flooding we saw over last spring and in previous years, it is clear that we need to fundamentally change the way the Missouri River is managed, Clearly what we're trying to do is to do what we can to both stabilize and encourage an economy that's really got a set of consequences going on and actions going on we haven't seen before, I've counted the votes long enough to be fully confident when it's over, It's for sure bad for democracy that the House didn't do their job. They've already presented their entire case about three times already, and apparently we're going to hear it two or three more times tonight, I feel confident that this will be a problem that will not impact more people than would usually be impacted by something like the flu, but, again, we need to prepare for the very worst, hope for the very best. But that's not the point. The point is what Speaker Pelosi made early and often, which was that impeachment should never be a partisan exercise. We have to give it a pretty significant cooling-off period before getting back into how these rules should work, It's not a very deep case. We should want to be the easiest state to transfer your skills in the minute you move here, You know, as I recall, President [ Bill ] Clinton gave his State of the Union in the middle of that process, and I would expect-no reason to believe that same thing wouldn't happen, Generally we do the same thing if there's a flu outbreak, which is encourage people to take care of themselves, Jack Buechner was a good friend and an extraordinary legislator, Not would the witness tell us something we might not know because we just like to know. But would the witness change the result and is it worth continuing to reward the bad performance of the House to stretch this out for not change in outcome. I think we have to give a couple of days' notice to the president to come, Our number one trading partner is Mexico, our number two trading partner is Canada. We just made an agreement, also, with the third biggest economy in the world, Japan, and the second biggest economy in the world, China, If I were him I'd avoid that subject. There's plenty to talk about and it's time to move on. But the other option is to address it head-on and he often is a head-on kind of guy, I think phase four needs to first of all be focused on what we find are the shortcomings in phase three. There had to be some. There was no way we could put a package together that quickly, though we needed to put it together that quickly, and have not left some gaps. And we need to fill those gaps, There are plenty of opportunities for members to reach out if they wanted to, if they had advice or thoughts, and I imagine some of that's happened just during the time the President's team has been here, The other question on witnesses is would the witness change the result, Everything is not always everything it seems to be. By the end of the three days we'd all figured out we were all sitting there so they could talk to whoever was watching television at the time. I think that was a bad strategy on their part, It's been a full week now since the president asked for an increase [ for ] Paycheck Protection. It's very possible it's now obvious that something else has come up. I would think that money for rural hospitals and other hospitals that didn't benefit as much as they should have from that first distribution... would be in place to have that discussion, I assume there is some method to his [ remarks ]. But the other option is to address it head on -- and he is often a head on kind of guy. I think the access that the press has is very similar to what it usually has, I mean closed session, I think our members are generally not interested in a motion to dismiss, They're not all getting better. The ones that died aren't getting better. If you really want to shut the Senate down, just send them a vague article of impeachment. I think individual members will know if they've had much contact with him in the last week or not. What a great ballplayer, But that would still be a year or a year and a half before that vaccine would move beyond the trial stage. So we will not have a vaccine in the next 12 or 18 months.

My office stands prepared. I certainly stand prepared to do anything I can to assist in facilitating federal resources being applied as appropriate and as provided for in law, I'm still not feeling any symptoms, ignorant or indifferent to the Constitution. We're not talking about some abstract interest in any sort of corruption that might exist in Ukraine but if you have a sitting vice president making public policy decisions to benefit his family to the tune of a million bucks a year that raises a serious question of corruption and a president not only is justified in asking for that to be investigated but has a responsibility to see that that's investigated and that was a question not about Ukrainian corruption, but a question about American corruption and Ukraine being integral in helping investigate whether there was, in fact, American corruption. Important SCOTUS victory for securing the border.

I'm very confident we will call Hunter Biden. ok when it comes to impeachment what's going on, what's going on with Ukraine and Burisma and Joe Biden and what are all of these issues and what does the constitution say about it. These two proposals, in any sane and rational world, would be agreed to unanimously, The W.H.O. has been far too willing to parrot Chinese propaganda. When President Trump's lawyers stand up and present their defense, they are going to have the opportunity to present the very significant evidence that supported and still supports this investigation into corruption and Burisma and whether Joe Biden participated in that corruption, all of the evidence of Burisma corruption that would justify any president saying we need to investigate... I walked through the timeline and the facts. a global espionage operation masquerading as a telecom company, I think that 2018 race is foreshadowing for 2020, The Senate has the sole authority to try impeachment. It is the Senate's duty to take up these articles without delay, and to resolve them in a timely and constitutionally appropriate manner. I expect tomorrow's likely to be a long night, but then I think we will move to the final judgment. Today, 102 Americans died while the Democrats blocked consideration of this bill, Spreading is a pernicious disease that has undermined the very essence of high school and college debate. In no other endeavor in life do you get rewarded for speaking ridiculously quickly, unless you hope to appear in a FedEx commercial. whole interaction was probably less than 60 seconds.

The next president is going to face challenges from global health security, like what we're seeing coming out of China.

I often say that my marriage exists by the grace of a single vote on the Supreme Court, but that vote would never have been possible without your tireless work over the last 50 years.

We will empower law enforcement by increasing the FBI's domestic counterterrorism field staff and pass federal legislation to expand our ability to track hate.

Q76,"Which is why you have somebody like a Greta Thunberg who gets so much traction, Let's stipulate that this is all insane. constructed from the best of our traditions and will have to account for the darker aspects of our past... and we'll need to remind ourselves, despite all our differences, just how much we share: common hopes, common dreams, a bond that will not break When I examined Judge Roberts's record and history of public service it is my personal estimation that he has far more often used his formidable skills on behalf of the strong in opposition to the weak. Harry Truman said the buck stops with you. We are going to have a science-based, fact-based approach to all of the policy steps we take. if all he is doing is throwing stones, he probably won't get that far. we're told that tougher gun laws won't stop all murders; that they won't stop every deranged individual from getting a weapon and shooting innocent people in public places. But the evidence shows that they can stop some killings. They can save some families from heartbreak. We are not helpless here. And until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening. what happens during primaries is you get a little ouchy that preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States. The biggest mistake any [ of ] us can make in these situations is to misinform, particularly when we're requiring people to make sacrifices and take actions that might not be their natural inclination. And when we think about our faith, the thing at root that we think about is not only Christ sacrificing himself on our behalf but it's also the golden rule, you know? Treat others the way you'd want to be treated. And I think that's what we try to impart to our kids. And that's what motivates me as president. Throughout history, women have driven humanity forward on the path to a more equal and just society, contributing in innumerable ways to our character and progress as a people, And I said this to President Castro in Cuba. I said, look, you've made great progress in educating young people. Every child in Cuba gets a basic education -- that's a huge improvement from where it was. Medical care -- the life expectancy of Cubans is equivalent to the United States, despite it being a very poor country, because they have access to health care. That's a huge achievement. a lot of American people So many Americans right now are stepping up to help their communities. Zohaib Begg, a 7-year-old from VA, is one of them. This inspiring kid has been gathering supplies from hotels to donate to the medical professionals at his local hospital, Years from now, generations to come will analyze the way in which we handled wars and made peace. That will be our shadow. The respect we gain as a generation will, as Obama says, not come from who our fathers and mothers were but how we did things. If we are to leave a good impression behind us, we would have to act as we actually live ... in big and diverse societies like ours, progress ultimately depends on something more basic, and that is how we see each other. It protected preexisting conditions, cut the uninsured rate in half, and lots more. But it's still under political attack right when we need care the most. We have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone. basic principles... recognized around the world. slashed hundreds of millions of dollars from PEPFAR. I have to thank Obama for putting us on his list. Personally, he's always been on mine. And if you don't get that, watch season 1 of Fleabag, robust system of testing and monitoring We are now all rooting for [ Trump's ] success in uniting and leading the country... Everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after we have to remember we're actually all on one team.

All I can tell you, whether it's Iraq, whether it's DOMA, whether it's `don't ask, don't tell' -- those were difficult votes. I was there, on the right side of history, and my friend Joe Biden was not. Anybody who suggests that at this point we are ending the campaign is not telling the truth, At a time when tens of millions of women use birth control, there is no valid reason to restrict a woman's access to safe, widely-used preventive services simply because her employer does not approve of what should be her private medical decisions. If turnout is high, we win. Instead of spending $1.8 trillion dollars a year collectively on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, Our job is to tell them, `Sorry, we are coming together and we are going to create a country and an economy that works for all of us, not just you, Mike Bloomberg has more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans. That's wrong and immoral That is what we need to do in order to win against Trump. Well, first of all, I'm not quite sure -- I have not seen that study. You may want to go back to my role in the House where year after year after year, guess which member of Congress got more amendments passed on the floor of the House than any other in a bipartisan way. So I don't accept that. we're going to do it nationally. You see because poor people are down here, they don't deserve, they don't eat, they don't pay rent, they don't go to the doctor, they're somehow inferior because they're poor, gon na give them less. What the United Nations tells us... if we do not stop the heating of the planet -- what we will be looking at, at the end of this century, are hundreds of millions of peoples around the world who are climate refugees. After four decades of the Cold War and trillions of United States taxpayer dollars allocated to compete in the arms race, many of our constituents understand that it is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe, let alone assuming more than our share of any costs associated with expanding NATO eastward. No campaign has a grassroots movement like we do, which is another reason we're going to win this election. opposed the Brady Bill... [ and ] the seven-day waiting period.

And what they are doing, by the way, the ugly thing that they are doing, and I've seen some of their tweets and stuff, is they try to divide us up, If elected president, it will get worse than that. it is the Jewish people. Let's win the nomination, let's defeat Trump, let's transform this country, But we also have to face the truth and that is that the number of casualties may actually be even higher than what the armed forces experienced in World War II. In other words, we have a major, major crisis and we must act accordingly. government must be clear that in the midst of this emergency, that everyone in our country -- regardless of income or where they live -- must be able to get all of the health care they need without cost. if we have the highest voter turnout in New Hampshire primary history, I am confident that we are going to win here in New Hampshire and if we win here in New Hampshire, we're going to set the pace to win Nevada and South Carolina and California. I think at a very early age, before my political thoughts were developed, I was aware of the horrible things that human beings can do to other people in the name of racism or white nationalism, in this case Nazism. This is the time to be working with China, Unfortunately, in this time of international crisis, it is clear to me at least that we have an administration that is largely incompetent. We don't want people to risk their lives in order to cast a vote, When you have a half a million Americans sleeping out on the street today, when you have 87 million people uninsured or underinsured... and then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that is a moral and economic outrage.

Q350843,"A fair trial involves witnesses and it involves documents, Senators, there is a storm blowing through this Capitol! What the President's counsel said was that no foreign policy was being conducted by a private person here. That is Rudy Giuliani was not conducting U.S. foreign policy. Rudy Giuliani was not conducting policy. That is a remarkable admission, You can trust he'll do what's right for Donald Trump. There is no reason not to have him come forward and testify unless you just want to cover up the president's wrongdoing. Well, that's a different question than whether the White House lawyers found out what's in it, It does not proscribe a process for a fair trial, and the American people desperately want to believe that the Senate will give both the president and the House of Representatives a fair trial, an illegitimate abuse of the trial As if you would expect the two leaders on the phone to say, `OK, this is how the bribery is going to work. This is how the shakedown is going to work. ' interposed the power of the Presidency Over the coming days, you will hear remarkably consistent evidence of President Trump's corrupt scheme and cover up, if any part of the president's motivation was a corrupt motive -- it was a causal factor in the action to freeze the aid or withhold the meeting -- that is enough to convict him, They have now acknowledged that the person in charge of this [ Rudy Giuliani ] was not conducting policy. That is a startling admission. the administration screwed up this response. Now he is willing to come forward. The Senate must allow testimony from him, Mulvaney and others. The cover-up must end. We need the four votes, Jennifer Williams has classified information to share with you that I hope you'll take a look at because it is relevant to these issues, Trump could offer Alaska to the Russians in exchange for support in the next election, or decide to move to Mar-A-Lago permanently and leave Jared Kushner to run the country, delegating to him the decision whether they go to war. all steps must now be taken can't tell us anything. then a whole range of utterly unacceptable conduct in a president would now be beyond reach. Trump could offer Alaska to the Russians in exchange for support in the next election... Yes, he's running for president. He's still a U.S. citizen, and he deserves better than that. Yet another reason why we ought to hear from witnesses just as we predicted, Qasem Soleimani was a malign force responsible for the death of many Americans, was responsible for unthinkable violence and world is better off without him, I don't think that's at all the desire, motivation here. The desire is to get a commitment from the Senate that they're going to have a fair trial, fair to the president, yes, but fair to the American people. He has betrayed our national security, and he will do so again, It is absolutely an abuse of power. And what's more, if you believe that a president can essentially engage in any corrupt activity as long as he believes that it will assist his reelection campaign and that campaign is in the public interest, then what's to stop a president from tasking his intelligence agencies to do political investigations? What's to stop him from tasking the Justice Department? If he can come up with some credible or incredible claim that his opponent deserves to be investigated, their argument would lead you to the conclusion that he has every right to do that. about Russian tradecraft... the vulnerabilities they look for. Would it have been impeachable if Barack Obama had tried to get Medvedev to do an investigation of Mitt Romney whether it was justified or unjustified? in the optimism of the founders. disclosure of these discriminating documents reinforces the need for all of these materials to be produced, and that a fair trial in the Senate cannot take place without them. not contest that the president solicited a foreign nation to interfere in our election, to help him cheat. Why did he stop the aid this year and not the prior year? Are we to believe it's merely a coincidence it was the year Joe Biden was running for president? I ask you, I implore you, fight them over there so we won't have to fight them over here. it will not prove the president innocent, it will only prove the Senate guilty of working with the president to obstruct the truth from coming out. Now the verdict is in: One Republican Senator had the courage to do impartial justice. To put country over party. And vindicate the Founders' faith in self-governance. And show us, Right still matters. This is how alliances wither and die, and how Russia wins, There is no fobbing this off on others, What you see is a president who identifies the state as being himself....

Q1857141,"Again, have a fair process, You can solve that problem without slowing down innovation, and that is the real balance. Any responsible commander-in-chief would have done the same thing, but President Trump's the one who did it, and I'm glad that the president had the fortitude to say we're going to put America first. We're going to protect America and our allies around the world by doing this. And you know, if somebody wants to criticize him for it, I think they're going to have to look at a mirror and say, whose side are you on if you can question something that actually makes America safer? By the way, don't just take our word for it. This is Obama's administration that deemed him a terrorist, and you go back to Osama bin Laden's killing. When President Obama... gave the order to do [ kill Osama bin Laden ], we commended President Obama for doing it. It was the right action, and when the president takes the right action -- clearly we disagreed with Obama on many, many things -- but on that, he got it right, and we commended him for it. The Democrats showed on the other side they can't even learn to count, let alone manage the economy or take over your health care, This world is a safer place with Soleimani gone. For whatever reason, no matter what President Trump does, whether it works, [ Democrats ] find a way to criticize him, Donald Trump was presidential tonight, showing leadership, laying out very specific things, calming the American public, letting them know how serious this is but what steps are being taken. But he showed tonight he's willing to work with anybody who wants to help you to address the problems of this country. Look, for months she was saying how important it is, they've got to remove this president immediately, he's a threat to their, you know, their whole way of life. And then, once they pass the impeachment, she doesn't want the Senate to get the papers to start the trial. They can't have it both ways. I get to kind of refresh the dust off those old skills, disgraceful and unbecoming of a speaker, Dems have moved so far left and are so afraid of their socialist base that they can't even condemn a murderous communist regime anymore, How can you sit here and try to apologize for the things that he did by saying taking him out was wrong? It's clear: Impeachment was a Democrat hit job to stain Trump's legacy and hurt him at the polls. Nothing more. Why do people rush to politicize even something like this? Hopefully during a time like this we can all come together, not as Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans who recognize that a brutal terrorist who killed hundreds of Americans and was planning to kill even more is gone from this planet because of the bold action of President Trump, The natural progression of socialist policies is a totalitarian state that deprives its citizens of basic freedoms and human rights, When they say `Medicare for All' - which, in their plan, they take away the private insurance that 180 million Americans enjoy -- are you gon na let them take away your health care choices? a major step in the right direction to provide flood protection for thousands of families and businesses in southeast Louisiana. I haven't seen anybody who is against this bill. It's not the Senate's role to mop up the mess that the House made when Speaker Pelosi rammed this thing through, This idea that the rules of the game don't apply to them [ is ] the real bottom line with liberalism, and now socialism, in general, So much for `somber' and `solemn.

But Pelosi's standing in the way, and a lot of Democrats that claim to be pro-life are hiding behind her and letting her do the dirty work. He won't be able to kill anybody else. Because he's been taken out. President Trump, I think, has sent a strong message to Iran and any other terrorists around the world, this is serious business. If you come after America, we're going to come after you with lethal strength and overwhelming strength. Donald Trump supporters shouldn't have to fear for their lives while registering people to vote. There's no place for violence in politics. We settle differences at the ballot box. Our nation is not the same as it was a month ago, It was the right thing to do when President Trump gave the command to take out Soleimani, stain on the Democrat party [ and ] on Speaker Nancy Pelosi's speakership, The modernization and simplification of our federal firearm purchasing laws is long-overdue reform, and I thank my colleagues for joining me in this effort. The killing of terrorists used to be something we all applauded. When Barack Obama gave the order to kill Osama bin Laden, we had a lot of policy disagreements with Obama, but we applauded, as Republicans and Democrats, that a bloody terrorist was killed.

Q3090307,"An aide in another Senate office has tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus; other congressional employees are likely to test positive in the days ahead. The most sensible course of action for the public and the congressional workforce under the circumstances is for my staff to telecommute, Iran, although oftentimes portrayed as 10 feet tall, is in fact a weak and feeble power. The United States is infinitely more powerful than Iran. They fear us; we should not fear them. And China right now is not giving any evidence on that question at all. Because China, through its dishonesty and corruption, turned what could have been a manageable local outbreak into a global pandemic that will ultimately cost not only our people, but the world, trillions and trillions of dollars, and hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives.

We can't continue to depend on China for anything that is critical for our nation, In Iraq alone, over the last 17 years, Qasem Soleimani killed over 600 Americans, I've seen those reports, and Twitter and the internet are alive with them, That plan starts with this big pause, as we protect ourselves and each other. We simply don't have the resources today to fight any other way. But it won't end with this approach. We must use the precious days and weeks ahead to lay the groundwork for a new strategy to fight the virus, a strategy that will allow all of us to gradually get back to work. Greg Tabor will serve the people of Arkansas the same way that he served the citizens of Fayetteville -- with honor and distinction, China turned what could have been a local health problem in Wuhan into a global pandemic and there will have to be a reckoning once we're through this pandemic, The House Democrats have not proven their case against Donald Trump -- we don't need to prolong this matter, Sad, not surprising. Given their dishonesty and the proximity of these labs, which we know were working with coronaviruses, it is only reasonable and responsible for us to ask the question and demand the answers. Good morning. There was a 28% increase in coronavirus cases overnight in China. Make no mistake, though: these aren't `new' cases. Just what China is willing to admit. It's much worse. In my opinion, Xi Jinping had decided if China is going to suffer, then the rest of the world, especially the United States, is going to suffer and there has to be consequences for those actions, Allowing Huawei to build the U.K.'s 5G network today is like allowing the KGB to build its telephone network during the Cold War, We know that it didn't start in the Wuhan food market. That was the original story of the Chinese Communist Party, so it's only responsible to ask where it did start, Bret Baier's reporting tonight, if it bears out, shows that the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for every single death, every job lost, every retirement nest egg lost from this coronavirus, and Xi Jinping and his Chinese Communist apparatchiks must be made to pay the price. If that turns out to be true. The American left and media cover relentlessly for Iran's murderous regime, very disappointing to see the other party trying to politicize Allowing Huawei to the [ sic ] build the UK's 5G networks today is like allowing the KGB to build its telephone network during the Cold War. The CCP [ Chinese Communist Party ] will now have a foothold to conduct pervasive espionage on British society and has increased economic and political leverage over the UK. China must open completely to WHO and international scientists, I think every effort we can make ought to be directed towards preventing outbreaks, or at least reducing the size of outbreaks. That's how we will prevent it from becoming a general outbreak across the country, if we can't prevent it, On the list of reasons why we should impeach and remove a president for the first time in our nation's history, I think most Arkansans would agree, temporarily pausing aid to Ukraine is pretty far down at the bottom, Hey, Leader, hey Mitch, this is a deadly situation and I do not trust the Chinese.

We do have some well-off people who support Democratic candidates, there's no doubt about that, but they've never bought a TV station. They've never gobbled up radio stations. They've never created newspapers in local communities to put out propaganda. That's all been done not just by Murdoch and Fox, but by Sinclair and by the Koch brothers and by so many others who have played a long game about how we really influence the thinking of Americans. regrets about her lengthy association with Weinstein And for the Democratic voters, try to vote for the person you think is most likely to win -- because, at the end of the day, that is what will matter.

It's his leadership team, His campaign and his principal supporters were just very difficult, We're not getting adequate medical care for prenatal exams and treatment for birth and delivery, and as a result there are many places in the United States that have a third-world rate of maternal mortality. I have said for many, many years that a presidential system is much harder for a woman to win than a parliamentary system, mostly for the good. Of course, if all of us had known what we know now, it would have affected our behavior, Personally, I'd love to have a woman on the ticket, finally-again. We've had two women vice presidential candidates - one for the Democrats, one for the Republicans I mean, I did get more votes both in the primary, by about 4 million, and in the general election, by about 3 million. I think that both the press and the public have to really hold everybody running accountable for what they say and what their campaign says and does. ... so there's criticism, and I understand that We're so divided right now and we're so hostile toward people that we think don't agree with us or somehow are different from us that somebody has to start trying to bridge that gulf. We'll take our record to the voters and let them decide, And we should be kinder and more supportive to everybody who makes the best decisions they think they can make.

Thankfully, I still have a voice and a following. But I do think it's important to look at somebody's record and look at what they've gotten done and see whether you agree with that or not.

Q24313,"Any American can be tested. We're removing that barrier. to get the results of that as quickly as possible for every American. We understand you may be reporting to your state, but the data is needed at the federal level to support FEMA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in their efforts to support states and localities in addressing and responding to the virus, where the virus first emerged late last year, and which has suffered the vast majority of infections -- by imposing travel controls and shutting down public events. Italy on Saturday saw its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases since the outbreak began in the north of the country on Feb. 21. In its daily update, Italy's civil protection agency said the number of people with the coronavirus rose by 1,247 in the last 24 hours, taking the total to 5,883. Another 36 people also died as a result of the virus, taking the total to 233. There was chaos and confusion in the northern Italian city of Padua in the Veneto region as word spread late Saturday evening that the government was planning to announce the quarantine. Packed bars and restaurants quickly emptied out as many people rushed to the train station in Padua. Travellers with suitcases, wearing face masks, gloves and carrying bottles of sanitizing gel shoved their way on to trains. Before Conte signed the quarantine decree, Stefano Bonaccini, president of the Emilia Romagna region, said parts of the decree were confusing, and he asked the premier for more time to come up with solutions that were more â € œcoherent. â €  Around the world, events and festivals have been called off. Travel restrictions and warnings have been issued. A nose-dive in tourist traffic and possible disruptions to supply chains have set off fears of a worldwide economic slowdown. Benchmarks in global markets have gyrated in recent weeks, as hopes for stimulus measures mixed with widespread pessimism on the virus news. Saudi Arabia has banned spectators at any sports competitions starting Saturday. The NBA, as well as British and Japanese sports teams are considering the same, as baseball and soccer seasons are starting. The spread of the virus has also taken a psychological toll. Authorities and manufacturers have been trying to assure panicking consumers they donâ € ™ t need to hoard toilet paper, which have vanished from store shelves in various nations. A particular point of concern are passenger-packed cruise ships, many of which are confronting their own virus problems. Officials in California were deciding Saturday where to dock the Grand Princess cruise ship, after 21 tested positive for the virus. There is evidence the ship now idling off San Francisco was the breeding ground for a deadly cluster of almost 20 cases during an earlier voyage. â € œThose that will need to be quarantined will be quarantined, will only confirm what people already know: is that the president had concerns, and in his authority the president made a decision. It's really astonishing to think that the party of Harry Truman and JFK is actually on the verge of nominating an avowed socialist as their party's standard bearer, President Reagan said it was morning in America. President Trump said `make America great again. How great is it to have a president who embraces his role as leader of the free world? It made me very thankful for the support from male mentors I have received over the years, Then we wake up after a decade of a socialist dictatorship. Almost 5 million people in that country have fled to neighboring lands. Do not buy facemasks. We are working very closely with California, Washington state, New York, Florida to develop community specific recommendations for those areas where we've had what is known as community spread -- a number of coronavirus cases that is being transmitted, We've vastly increased the supply of medical masks, and we're going to continue to put a priority on making sure that we're calling on industry at every level. I believe that the Church in the U.S. has been a bulwark in the right to life movement since Roe v Wade was first adopted by our Supreme Court in 1973, There were no American casualties, no coalition casualties, and as the president said yesterday, we continue to believe that Iran is standing down, Not only did that result in hundreds of thousands of lost lives in Syria, but it was shortly thereafter that Russia overran Crimea and Russian surrogates compromised eastern Ukraine.

I got the general point you were trying to make the fourth time you told me, one of the greatest humanitarian disasters in decades We're in a conflict with the theology, the ayatollah, and his way of doing business. What do I have to do to tomorrow or the next day to get them back into a deterrent mode to leave us alone? You can't let her use the rules against us. Hopefully we can do it before Easter, but it's got to be conditioned, I can prove beyond any doubt that Joe Biden's effort in the Ukraine to root out corruption was undercut, because he let his son sit on the board of the most corrupt company in the Ukraine, and we're not going to give him a pass on that, You can't stimulate it. We're buying containment. Everything I've just talked to you about is the price of containment. Shutting every bar and restaurant down in South Carolina is the cost of containment. We either pay now as a country or we pay later, and what we do until we turn the corner and what would turning the corner look like? A week where you have less infections than the week prior, therapies are in place and reduce the mortality rate, We are dealing with religious Nazis, Your hatred of Donald has blinded you to the obvious. This is not about protecting the country, this is about destroying the president, That approach by Sen. Graham is one that will lead us directly into war, then we're going to go to Hunter Biden, Joe Biden and all these people. Soleimani was one of the most ruthless and vicious members of the Ayatollah's regime. He had American blood on his hands. I was really disappointed in [ Democratic lawmakers' ] behavior in [ the classified briefing ] because it was clear to me that this guy [ Soleimani ] was up to no good in the moment.

I don't think that's appropriate. make sure that Hunter Biden's conflict of interest is explored because it's legitimate. How could Joe Biden really fight corruption when his son `s sitting on the Burisma board? When it comes to Kashmir, I do not know how it ends but let us make sure that two democracies will end it differently Well, number one, Mr. President, the American people understand what you've done for them, and this effort to destroy Trump no matter the cost of the country is getting a bit old, and it's pissing a lot of people off, It could. I don't know yet. The White House said there was no direct evidence of communications, maybe this suggests that one person said there might be, I would vote not to have witnesses. They really mean it when they want to destroy Israel and kill all the Jews and they've been disrupting the Mideast for 40 years, no different than the old evidence, documents related to former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's previous work in Ukraine directly contacting former Department employees to schedule transcribed interviews and will advise the Department when those interviews are scheduled so that Department counsel may attend. The ability to refine oil. So what President Trump has done is up the ante as high as you can up it. He's killed the most consequential military leader in Iran. He's killed the guy who is spreading terror throughout the world. When you say that Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism. The question is who leads that effort? It was Soleimani. They will not let this go unanswered. The Senate should not reward this behavior by the House. The Senate should end this trial as quickly as possible. That's what I intend to do.

Florida law requires 1,200 hours to become licensed as a barber, in order to assess the performance of the project.

First, we don't know the extent of the crisis in terms of the magnitude, so that could rise. But there are going to be problems that we don't realize now that we're going to have to grapple with.

What he (Trump) did was not `perfect... No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep one's self in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine. All seniors, especially those like me who are over 70, must take every precaution: We are the ones most likely to suffer the most severe complications from COVID-19 that will overwhelm the health care system. Please, follow strict social-distancing and even consider self-quarantine, to be as impartial as the oath requires. I'd like to see us investing more than we have been and probably more than we're even planning at this stage to make sure that, in the event that something comes to this country and were to spread, that we're able to care for our people, The current bill has promise but it shouldn't give lower earners smaller checks -- that's directly contrary to my proposal. We need to fix this to ensure lower earners get equal payments. relevant and therefore I'd like to hear it. expansions of paid leave, unemployment insurance, and SNAP benefits The fact that cutting checks is suddenly such a popular idea across the political spectrum demonstrates how much the Left has shifted what's considered possible over the past decade. But it also shows us a ruling class and a political order that is desperately trying to find a stopgap measure to prevent social collapse, in the vain hope of returning to `normal' in short order. My son Josh brought over tons of food. He went to Costco this morning and brought in all sorts of supplies for me: ramen, rice, beans, peanut butter, hotdogs, hamburger -- all of my favorite food groups. It is increasingly apparent that it would be important to hear from John Bolton, that would be something I'd be considering were I in their position. Our legislation will amend current law to enhance access to broadband communications in rural parts of our state that are currently underserved. Bob's contributions to our state, to our economy, and to our church will be heralded by many. But for me, it was his sound and principled leadership as the Chairman of the Olympic Winter Games of 2002 that is most compelling, the hope that he would be able to say something exculpatory and create reasonable doubt, so I wouldn't have to vote to convict. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security interests, and our fundamental values. I will accept whatever consequence is sent my way and recognize that's part of the job. People don't expect me to be a shrinking violet, I have gone through a process of thorough analysis and searching, and I have prayed through this process. I do believe he should be removed from office. That's the vote I will take in just a short while, There was that famous Romney data failure in 2012 that's almost exactly the same problem as this, I think it's very likely I'll be in favor of witnesses, but I haven't made a decision finally yet, and I won't until both sides' opening arguments are done, By prioritising costs, the UK is sacrificing national security and inviting the CCP's surveillance state in. I implore our British allies to reverse their decision. I agonized over the responsibility that ultimately would come my way. I hoped beyond hope that I would not have to find him guilty of what had been alleged. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential, I think people are tired of these political investigations and would hope that if there is something that needs to be evaluated it would be done by perhaps the FBI or some other agency that perhaps is not as political as a committee of our body. put aside a lot more face masks and gowns and booties, if you will, and goggles and so forth, for medical personnel than we have. That is an area we ought to consider making an investment in, when she was guiding it... America's interests were diminished at every corner of the world. She compromised our national secrets. She dissembled to the families of the slain. And she jettisoned her most profound beliefs to gain presidential power. We have to determine whether any of use should self-quarantine as a result being in the same room, You saw news reports of individuals thinking about witnesses, and have been thinking about before.

The moment they ran, there was Fox News, kind of right there ready to elevate. But I also think that people want to discuss these ideas more. What we should seriously start to consider now for the medium & long term (bc it will take time) is New Deal-style policy. We need a mix of policies to help put a lot of people to work. Climate transition, [ education ] expansion w / apprenticeships & colleges, [ Medicare for All ]. It should also go without saying that sites like Persepolis (& its PEOPLE) are not only treasures to Iranians, they are gifts to humanity. and I said, `We're going to move forward. Let's do this together. And if you look at must-pass legislation, this Congress is engaged in climate denial. You would think Claire Chase... would step up to rescue, I don't know, our entire energy industry, And as you all know, we don't have to tell you, that the name of the game here is electorate expansion and bringing people out to vote that the normal political establishment counts on not turning out. Why do you have to make it about race? It's because it is about race. We are being discriminated from living in certain neighborhoods, from access to certain leases, codified in economic policy. Everyone realizes we are all in this together, Let me be clear: it has never been more important to finally guarantee healthcare as a human right by passing Medicare for All, The Green New Deal [ was ] worded very deliberately, Every year we sacrifice human lives for the sake of our for-profit healthcare system, & next year is poised to get worse, I mean honestly, have you ever had a point in your life where the federal government did too much for you? Where they gave you too much money? Never happened to me, I've never seen that in my life, So is every young person, Trump's lawless conduct & subversion of the Constitution. Absolutely. You know, obviously there's also more that we need to do in terms of turning out youth voters. It's -- we need to make sure that we're inspiring young people to turn out, but when you do turn out, you should not be waiting three, four, seven hours in order to vote. And that causes people to leave. It's a place where millions of people are descendants of immigrants who came w nothing & made a life. Overall, not just President Trump but this entire administration knew what was coming. Trump knew this pandemic was coming. The military knew this pandemic was coming. The CDC knew this pandemic was coming. HHS Health and Human Services knew this pandemic was coming. There was a structural but also universal refusal to acknowledge and, more importantly, to act. This pandemic and the casualties we are seeing is again not just do to coronavirus. There are people dying unnecessarily. I would hope [ Bloomberg ] would not be in a position to be choosing a running mate at all, We have 10 days left. Elected officials often don't lead our most impactful societal changes, they follow them. The heroes who lead true change are the activists, artists, organizers & others who educate + push society forward. I don't think a lot of people out there really understand the systemic shock that is being experienced in the economy right now, But unity is a process, and figuring out what that looks like is part of this whole conversation that I think Bernie and Warren and other folks are a part of, as well. It is something that we're not allowed to talk about. It is something that we have difficulty acknowledging, and even in the presence of this legislation. This legislation that I am putting forward along with my colleagues is literally just to recognize poverty in America. That's it. Just directing someone, agencies to just measure the level of poverty in this country. Because it's physically impossible to lift yourself up by a bootstrap, by your shoelaces.

Q1280288,"It is something we asked him early in the campaign, do you read? I asked, can you read? Are you capable of reading? Susan Collins, I'm curious do you really still think Donald Trump learned his lesson, or if the lesson that Donald Trump learned is that with Senators like you giving him a blank check, he can do whatever the hell he wants. Vindman? That's on you. Sondland? That's on you. Roger Stone, Susan Collins, that's on you, and Lamar Alexander it's on you and it's on every Republican that taught Donald Trump once again, there are no consequences to his actions. Are you happy about America doing well over the past 11 years? I am. Anybody who believes Donald Trump is just stupid as hell, Republicans, they only seem to care about deficits or debts when Democrats are in the White House, but man, we're looking at bigger spending and more fiscal recklessness than ever before this year, It's not true, it was never true, They get distracted sometimes. I'm not just talking about our network, all the networks, they get distracted by the ground noise -- can you believe the president said this? Can you believe he tweeted that? No.. Get the facts, get his quotes, get the death toll, get the people in his administration that warning him from early January, put up his words, not your words. Please call Ron DeSantis since he doesn't have a backbone, apparently, since he still can't see everything that's been happening over the past couple of months and still won't do what is required to save senior citizens from this hellish end to their life, dying alone. Give him a call today, Mr. President, and tell him to do the right thing and shut down Florida. This impacts you too. If you don't want to do it for the right reason, do it for the political reason. You talk about drug deals, We're all joined together as a country, fighting an epidemic that could end up -- let me say this again, based on the study that got to the White House yesterday -- kill more people, kill more Americans than died in World War II, World War I, the Civil War, and Vietnam, a lot of buzz on Twitter Well, obviously that's not the case, Put this in context with, I suppose you could say with 9/11, the memos warning of al-Qaeda attacks using airplanes, maybe missed signals FDR didn't pick up on before Pearl Harbor. I really don't know, though, what parallel there can be, because so many more people are going to die because of these missed signals. They had all those school buses, Republicans were saying this especially. Well, the school buses are still in the parking lot, you have a president who has been saying hurricane wasn't coming, hurricane's not coming. The press scaring you about the hurricane coming, it's all a hoax. All these people in the media saying it was just a hoax. The truth will be known. It will be shouted from the mountaintops. It's just going to make the Republicans look worse, What are we doing now is my question? I mean, I'm seeing it on blog posts from pro-Trump people, I'm seeing it everywhere. Yet the president of the United States is still saying, `We have this completely under control, it's going to be okay, things are going to disappear. ' What is it about these Republican leaders, that they think that you can shoot a virus? They think your AR-15 is going to help a virus. They think some, like, macho display is somehow going to beat the virus? No, you can't. See, let me help you out here. You can't bully a virus, okay? You've got to outthink it, you can't be stupid. Taking your family out to a restaurant when the top scientists in the world are telling you to stay home and protect them. Then the next day, you're made a fool of, you have to call a national emergency, so you've admitted you put your family at risk, everybody around your family at risk. Have you seen him in the golf shirts? Have you seen him walking around lately? I mean, it is such a scam for people who are working 40, 50, 60 hours a week. They pay their taxes, and then they are paying the costs of the president of the United States taking a squad of people down to one of his resorts so he can lie around, play golf, eat, do next to nothing but occasionally kill an Iranian general and then they have to pay for it. What's fascinating is, He's spreading disinformation, he's trying to cover up all the mistakes he's made over the past two months, He is screwing working-class Americans who are paying him to not do his job at his resort while making him richer just sitting around in golf carts, waddling around playing golf. We saw this (with) this Mitt Romney in 2012. He watched Fox News, he looked at Gallup polls and was sure he was going to win, when the rest of America knew he was headed to defeat.

I love our country. I love the people of this country. No matter what happens here tonight, I want you to know that we have already been victorious. I'm confident that he will lead our country guided by the spirit of aloha, respect, and compassion. and I informed him that I would be running for President. In that meeting, he showed me the greatest respect and encouragement, as always. They're coming and saying, `Hey, Tulsi, we are confident that you as president, commander-in-chief, will actually end these long-standing regime change wars, ' when you have someone as powerful as Hillary Clinton seeking to smear my reputation, essentially implying that I'm a traitor to the country that I love -- what she essentially is doing is taking my life away. There's just been a lack of transparency... lack of transparency means lack of trust in the process and that they're trying to take the power away from votes to actually be the ones to decide who continues to move forward in this campaign, I'm really just focused on continuing that outreach that we've been doing. Make no mistake: Trump's actions are an act of war, This bill helps make sure testing is accessible and free for all, which is long overdue in containing the virus, funds paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, food for seniors and more. While today's bill is an important step forward, I will continue to work toward bringing about innovative solutions like my emergency Universal Basic Payment plan which will provide immediate, direct assistance for the American people to stay focused on the health and wellbeing of themselves and their loved ones. If you know anything about me, you know I don't play party politics, The point here is, what is the end goal? What is the strategy here? What mission are we trying to accomplish? And it's very clear Trump's actions have undermined our national security interests. It further escalates this tit-for-tat that's going on and on and on, and will elicit a very serious response from Iran and pushing us deeper and deeper into this quagmire. I couldn't watch much of it, to be honest, Even if it means meeting with a brutal dictator, focus on that objective, keeping the American people safe. After Tuesday's primary results, it is clear that Democratic Primary voters have chosen [ former ] Vice President Joe Biden to be the person who will take on President Trump in the general election, going to war with Iran would make the war in Iraq and even Afghanistan look like a picnic. spent her entire adult life serving this country. CNN's behavior is un-American and a betrayal of our democratic ideals. Will you stand with Tulsi against Trump's unconstitutional war? For every donation of $35 or more to this email today, we will send you a `No War With Iran' t-shirt, the proceeds of which will go towards spreading Tulsi's critical anti-war message in the early states. The other step that needs to be taken is that cruise ships should not be allowed to dock in Hawaii or any other state, Coming just over a month before Israel's third election in a year -- against the backdrop of [ Israeli ] Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's indictments -- releasing the plan now appears to be an inappropriate intervention in a foreign election, Testing is absolutely critical in our fight to defeat the spread of Coronavirus. While testing numbers have increased, both here and across the country, we are nowhere near the scale of testing proven to be effective in countries like South Korea, Trump's military strike against Iranian militia was impulsive, short-sighted, and lacked strategic purpose. It has led to our embassy being besieged and undermined our relationship with the Iraqi government and people.

There will be massive budget cuts across the state, That said, public health officials and the safety must be paramount in our decision-making. It's incredibly frustrating because there's a lot of talk about this device, there was a lot of hype on it nationally, how it was it wonderful, and when they showed up, expectations were set really high, as they should be, here in New Hampshire, we do it a little bit different, and we do it a lot better.

Michigan is at serious risk. I think about the Jason Hargroves on the buses, I think about the cops, I think about the nurses and the doctors in the hospitals who are going to work for you every single day. And for you not to honor the social distancing requests, you're putting really good people like Jason Hargrove's lives on the line. if you gave our healthcare workers and first responders hydroxychloroquine doses early on, could it prevent the disease, or if they do get the disease, could it be milder symptoms.

Q888132,"I expect the beginning of launching of his campaign, that in attributing Wednesday's attacks to Iranian-backed militia groups, the Trump Administration must admit its efforts to deter Iranian aggression are failing and American service members are paying the ultimate sacrifice. By enabling and encouraging the scourge of anti-personnel landmines around the world, President Trump has found yet another disturbing way to undo the progress made to restrict the harm to civilians these indiscriminate weapons cause, I'm sure all of those who died at Castro's hands and were shot at firing squads, all those who were tortured, those who live in my state and suffered enormously under the regime, the more than a million people who fled, I'm sure they all think that the literacy program was worth all of that.

No American citizen should be abandoned overseas as we confront this unprecedented pandemic simply because of a failure of government to provide them the su pport that they need, Community health centers are often the first place families across New Jersey go to when they need affordable and high quality health care, I don't think that from a Democratic perspective, there is this whole recalibration of what our foreign policy is, has not put forth a coordinated, robust response, which I fear puts the health of its own employees at further risk, and further jeopardizes the health and well-being of the American people, Faced by an Administration that has relentlessly sought to cut foreign development and humanitarian relief programs it incorrectly views as charity, I sincerely appreciated Administrator Green's commitment to defending programs and funds that are proven to advance US national security, help lift up the world's most impoverished, and build resilient and prosperous communities that in turn promote global stability, an accurate count of all persons -- I underline that, all persons -- living in the United States, I do not want to see ICE agents at health facilities, hospitals and other things because disease and viruses knows no quarter, I'll get a copy of the [ Congressional Record ] to review them again and look at the various fine points of the elements of both articles of impeachment, Women are the backbone of the RMG sector, clear political retaliation, the likes of which is seen only in authoritarian countries around the world.

I never would've had the opportunities that led me to Congress had I been rejected. What Beltrami County is doing is denying refugees a chance at a better life. This follows years of saber-rattling and threats of war against Iran by President Trump and his accomplices. We in Congress must exercise our Constitutional duty -- and do everything in our power to stop another disastrous war. It is okay to know that we never need permission or an invitation to get involved, to stand up, or to work on creating positive change in our communities. We must allow ourselves to internalize our power and not ever allow others to tell us or make us feel like we don't belong or something isn't for us, prevent an illegal war with Iran, When Bernie says us, we are included in that us, We need a moratorium on incarcerating people who are low risk to others.

We could be on the precipice of a global financial crisis unlike any seen since the 1930s. Facing a medical procedure is complicated enough.

Q1077819,"If this administration, under this President, is not going to do its job, Since last year's Trump shutdown I have repeatedly pushed my Republican colleagues to provide back pay to federal contract employees, many of whom make up janitorial and support staffs, awfully hard to explain to people back home Look, everybody knows that Soleimani was a very bad, despicable guy. There's no debate there. But the claim of an imminent threat they have not supported, and what we do know is this dramatic escalation is now putting Americans at greater risk, they will be telling America they do not want an impartial trial. Since President Trump took office he has drastically elevated tensions with Iran and brought us to the brink of war. President Trump's so-called campaign of `maximum pressure,' has resulted only in maximum failure, the need for the Senate to obtain all relevant documents and hear from key witnesses in order to have a fair trial. In my view right now it would be giving people unrealistic hope to proceed now. We should let people know immediately that Republicans have taken a u-turn, To prevent this type of farce from occurring again, the Senate must change its rules to require witnesses and documents, I very much worry about what the president is doing right now to escalate tensions and the likelihood of war in Iran, but our country will have to deal with both these issues at the same time. There may be one or two Republicans that want that, but that's very different than Republicans wanting that. Surely in a bill of $2 trillion dollars we can do right by the people of the District of Columbia and not shortchange them $750 million, Yes, those comments by the Chesapeake Bay coordinator at the EPA set off alarm bells because the TMDL's were written to be enforceable, President Trump is more unhinged by the hour, Look, everybody knows that Soleimani was a very bad, despicable guy, Today the administration announced we're sending 3,000 more troops to the region, Republican senators and the administration may try to dismiss it. But we now have a clear, lucid finding that the Trump administration violated the law and we know that the president ordered the administration to commit an illegal act. the only thing that has changed is who's in the White House. And the flip side of that is that if Republicans vote to block key witnesses and evidence, it will expose the trial as a fraud. fixing and rigging the trial When it comes to the importance of getting witnesses, relevant fact witnesses and relevant documents, on that question, the overwhelming majority of the American people recognize that a fair trial is necessary. So senators that don't want to look at the evidence will have to explain to their constituents why they want to rig the trial, But since their murders, the Senate has yet to take meaningful action to address gun violence, As seen in these documents, OMB provided incomplete responses and the White House flat out refused. The House charges of abuse of power do not relate directly to the [ 1974 budget law ], they relate to the president of the United States improperly using taxpayer funds to... pressure Ukraine into interfering in the 2020 election on his behalf, the boundaries of our constitutional republic to a real extreme. From all we've seen, including the redacted parts here and the briefing, the facts do not show an imminent threat. We must pass a bill making clear Trump can't start a war without a vote. I urge my colleagues to seek out the truth and the facts and to vote in support of my motion. Anything else constitutes an effort to hide the truth, bailing out the biggest corporations. I'm not one who subscribes to the collective freak-out that some people seem to be experiencing right now, Sometimes you are acting like BP's lawyer, and that is the problem here.

Providing the super-rich with a government-subsidized retirement account above and beyond a 401 (k) is indefensible. Republicans and Democrats alike have called for ending these tax breaks, and it's past time to get it done.

The President is fulfilling his promise to protect what works in our healthcare system and make it better, and more success is still to come. The President's bold leadership and the hard work of FDA and HHS's Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response have succeeded in securing this large donation of medicine. We'll continue working around the clock to get American patients access to therapeutics that may help them battle COVID-19, while building the evidence to evaluate which options are effective. We had no penetration into our networks, we had no degradation of the functioning of our networks, It's just different ways of phrasing it, The FDA and CDC's action to allow a wider range of respirators to be used in healthcare settings will help those on the front lines of this outbreak and their patients, which will keep all Americans safe, We aim to see whether e-cigarettes could serve as an effective off ramp for adult smokers addicted to combustible cigarettes.

Q719568,"We would find ourselves in a recurring impeachment nightmare, every time we elect a new president. If my Democratic friends who are running for the Senate have different views, I'd love to engage with them on the campaign trail on that.

But I want to ask you about the legal brief that Democrats did submit. It included a number of things, including documents that have been revealed recently by Lev Parnas, an indicted business associate of Rudy Giuliani. Among them, a letter that says that Rudy Giuliani himself was acting with the approval and knowledge of the president when he was reaching out to the president of Ukraine. Should all of these items be admissible during trial? It was more like they weren't talking to us, they were talking to the TV cameras and were enjoying their moment in the sun.

Our small businesses desperately need help -- now, This is a factual statement that's well borne out by the news media, that these open markets -- these wet markets in China -- are the source of the virus.

Q359888,"I think the administration needs to be candid. Not make people overly frightened, but just needs to be candid. And when somebody tells you something that you know is not true that actually adds to fear, I'm on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and we've not heard anything about it. An offensive war requires a congressional debate and vote. This should not be a controversial proposition. It's clearly stated in the Constitution. The question of whether the United States should be at war with Iran is a very different matter, and only Congress should decide that, and not the President, Emergency response calls to a senior living facility are not unusual, but when you see a spike it means we should be digging in deeper, I will not be part of this continual degradation of public trust, I think the public is going to be very very engaged in this debate, We've been talking to our constituents, we've been listening to them, and we know what they think about another war in the Middle East right now. (Trump's ] got an election that he's focused on and he wants to win... He could well veto it and then adjust behavior.

And the question is not whether Iran is a bad actor, they are. The question is whether the United States should be engaged in another unnecessary war in the Middle East. I believe it is very foolish for the U.S. to be involved in another war in the Middle East. But however you think about that question, should we be at war, I do know this. We should not go to a war with Iran based on a presidential decision with no consultation of Congress. We should only go to war with Iran if there is a congressional vote pursuant to the Constitution saying that we need to be at war. And so today I'm going to take the one step that I have available to me. I will file a resolution pursuant to the War Powers act of 1974 to try to force Congress to have a debate about whether or not it is in the United States' interests to be at war with Iran. I don't think it is. Some of my colleagues may think otherwise. But we can't let the president make this decision on his own. I think they're doing that to make the president happy, You want to see exactly everything what went wrong before you decide what the changes are, so I'll save what the changes should be for later, So many members of Congress, what they want to do is hide under their desks, let the president just do whatever the president wants, and then they think they can escape accountability for the consequences of war, We're not tying the President's hands.

Before there's a vote on conviction or acquittal, there's going to be a vote on whether this is a trial or a sham. That's what the vote's going to be, likely, on Friday: Is this a trial, or is this a sham? The resolution will force a public debate and vote in Congress as intended by the framers of the Constitution to determine whether United States forces should be engaged in these hostilities. The good news is this: We now have a majority of colleagues -- Democratic and Republican -- who will stand strong for the principle that we shouldn't be at war without a vote of Congress, I think they want to make the president smile, or laugh, or tweet, or something.

Visitors who do not have the virus can still come to the United States, and foreign investment in our businesses and economy will continue to be welcomed, but employment immigration will cease until our national unemployment rate is back below 3.5 percent, as it was in February before this pandemic. Rare exceptions will be granted only in critical, time-sensitive industries like farming, and only if the employer proves they tried to hire Americans first. It just seemed to go for an interminable amount of time. Nothing was found, as I expected. But it surely seemed to me it could have been done quicker. Nobody tells us how to vote or what to do. If we go to witnesses, he is absolutely relevant to the president's concern that something may have been covered up when the prosecutor in Ukraine that was investigating this company [ Burisma Holdings ] was removed, One report said there were zero cases under the last four years of the Obama administration, Look, the president has been hammered, Every rock has been unturned. Everything has been said about him, people investigate. You had the vice president of the United States, whose son is hired all of a sudden, paid $50,000 - $80,000 a month to serve on this energy company in Ukraine, which he knew little or nothing about.

I'm certainly willing to stand up to Democratic leftists and socialists and defend Alabama's values. I've proven that.

I think Val Demings is a bonafide candidate for Vice President of the United States, Bernie's going to have plenty of delegates and power to influence the platform, It's all he's thinking about right now. All the bluster we ahead about go ahead, impeach me, make my day. He hates this. He hates this is what he's going to be known as a president that was impeached for the rest of his career. And he hates it because he now has to use something else to defend him. That is the senators. I don't think he likes that. I think he likes to be the one. That's why he doesn't want anybody around him in the White House doing messaging. He wants to be the only messenger. The fact that he has to seed over his message to Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz and the rest of their ilk in the Senate makes him nervous. And he knows there's some senators that weren't in the room today if you noticed, and they are the ones that are probably most likely to vote in favor of witnesses and documents. It's a little bit like a presidential version of `Survivor, ' I speak with authority... this ad is meant to help Bernie. Not hurt him, he has jurisdiction over coronavirus and the federal response. Is he calling a hearing? Is he trying to figure out why first responders' tests aged on a shelf in the state of Washington until they were no longer good? Is he going to tell people why they can't get the test? No, His service goes back many years, for both parties. Not a partisan bone in his body. Is the 95% accurate, Steve? He thinks he's some brilliant business guy. He's wasting money of his campaign or his own money hiring lawyers because you and I both know the cease and desist orders, fact, they could sell them for what we're in short supply of right now.

The Foreign Affairs Committee's. No.. This joke Ron Johnson is actually politicizing Glenn Fine is one of the most experienced and respected IGs, Yeah, and the fact that this president doesn't take intelligence briefings, doesn't take them seriously has given the back of his hand to the intelligence community, going so far as to stand at a podium with Putin and basically say I believe Putin instead of my own intelligence community, sending his Attorney General all over the world, trying to get dirt on his intelligence community, and then he praises China in January, obviously, now they're trying to blame China, and we also just learned that he sends a letter to Kim Jong-un in North Korea saying we want to help you, well, what in the world? What is he doing offering help to a thug in North Korea who kills his own family for power and then tells governors in a phone call, `Hey, you guys are going to be better off just trying to buy your own stuff.' There is so much incompetence here. it was a speech that was full of lies. Mitch McConnell has presided over absolutely destroying Senate norms, from Merrick Garland to killing legislative debate, The conversation is going to quickly turn to how and when does Bernie Sanders unite the Democratic Party, First of all, it's an effective political ad, the best ads are ads where the person is actually speaking and makes the point for themselves. Nobody is manipulating his voice there. That's what he said. Now, the cease and desist orders, Nicole, as you well know, what a joke. I mean, the fact that he is paying someone to make these threats, shows you what a chump he is. The big haul of delegates comes on Super Tuesday, Jason Abend, who currently serves as senior policy advisor at United States Customs and Border Protection, to be the new DOD IG. My state has not done a statewide stay at home order. We're one of those ten states. The governor really has his priorities straight. He made sure nobody will have to pay a late penalty for renewing their conceal and carry license but declined to issue a stay at home order for the state. We have real problems here in my state. Using the guidance of my campaign staff and consultants, we came up with the idea for a `dog whistle' ad, a message that was pitched in such a way that it would be heard only by a certain group of people. I told my team we needed to put Akin's uber-conservative bona fides in an ad -- and then use reverse psychology to tell voters not to vote for him. And we needed to run the hell out of that ad.

Eat more corn on the cob! The corn isn't important, but the cobs are free and work great! (Just don't flush them!) You're welcome! There's nothing this president can do that will ever satisfy the people who hate him more than they hate the coronavirus. There will be peace in the Middle East when Palestinian mothers love their own children more than they hate Jewish children Not to continue the impeachment. That needs to end, Let me tell you something, he could personally suck the virus out of every one of the 60,000 people in the world and suck it out of their lungs, swim to the bottom of the ocean and spit it out and he would be accused of pollution for messing up the ocean if he did that. There is nothing this president can do that will ever satisfy the people who hate him more than they hate the coronavirus. even though he did commit a crime (perjury), lost his law license, and had to pay large settlement to Paula Jones for sexual harassment, in retrospect, perhaps censure would have been a better response just because despite there being bi-partisan participation in the impeachment, it was still polarizing and hurtful to the political process. It's killing people. People all around the world are dying. suck it out of their lungs, swim to the bottom of the ocean and spit it out, and he would be accused of pollution for messing up the ocean. Those of us from [ the ] rural south know how to handle toilet paper shortage. Eat more corn on the cob! The corn isn't important, but the cobs are free and work great! (Just don't flush them!) You're welcome! I'm sure there was nothing coordinated between the publishing the book and the presales and the fact that the New York Times, which can't find real news if they tried, they always seem to find these leaks. But more than that, he did notify them in the 48 hours that was required, Lindsey Graham has the power as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to do it. The Republicans are in the majority. The Democrats did their own investigation in the House. It was a total disaster because they didn't have anything... but this time, let the Democrats have their opportunity, the timing is just a little bit too cute, It's dishonorable, it's dishonest, it's disgusting, and people like that shouldn't be listened to. But what should start up is a legitimate investigation into not only Hunter Biden, but the origin of the dossier. We should find out about this `whistleblower.' Where did he get his information? Was he biased? Did he do this with some political intent? Was it because of his own personal feelings, or was it because he truly believed that there was something of national security at stake?

What you want to do is you want to put in place mitigation steps to reduce the peak number of cases -- you have to get them below the point at which the health care system gets exhausted. Because what happened in Wuhan, China, was the health care system got exhausted and fatalities rose quickly. It's basically isolating people with the infection and their close contacts. If you start to see this become epidemic in other nations or have other nations experiencing large outbreaks that's going to be extremely worrisome that we're not going to control this globally, If we have a Wuhan-style outbreak in New York City, that's going to overwhelm the system. So they need to be building surge capacity right now in anticipation of that possibility. There's ways to avert it, but that's the risk that we face right now. But I'm going to be more vigilant to make sure they don't have colds. We need a massive effort to offset the hardship of these efforts, and the public health costs they impose, as there are more than economic costs to measures we're taking. speaks with passion, poignance, and precision to the anxieties that Americans are rightly feeling. brought right to the brink the best infection control procedures, well-equipped hospitals, and skilled providers, So if youth use of e-cigarettes is shifting toward disposable products, that can happen quickly and basically evolve to epidemic use of these products before regulators spot it.

You can't just say, `Let this run through the population, ' What we need to do is what we call a master protocol, where we basically test a lot of drugs at once, Once deployed, serological tests are cheap, straightforward, and easy to scale.

What we have done is we've set forth a clear set of transparent, inclusive rules. Nobody who's been under 5 percent at this point in a primary has ever won a primary or caucus. We set those rules out in advance. And it's for the voters to decide. I think these four early primaries are really good opportunities for people to get to know candidates, for candidates to get to garner momentum, Leadership means being able to adapt, and that's exactly what our party is doing, problems that have emerged in the implementation of the delegate selection plan It's a dark comedy, in a sense.

He has political experience working with Republicans, which will help him win over moderate voters who are turned off by the idea of a socialist president. Plus, he'll have the backing of the Democratic donor base, who generally prefer him to Sanders. Look, sometimes politics makes strange bedfellows, but I think I speak for party leadership when I say that we'd much rather see Donald Trump than Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee.

And the American people will remember. They remembered it in 2017, 2018 and 2019. When health care was on the ballot, Democrats won in scale. Ultimately, the health and safety of our convention attendees and the people of Milwaukee is our top priority. And we will continue to be in contact with local, state, and federal health officials as we monitor this fluid situation.

Our everyday routines need to change to protect other people. These are some of the toughest decisions I have made as GovernorEvery Iowan is part of the solution. Iowans understand we're in this together. I don't know what is in store for us in the days ahead, but no one is better prepared to face this together than Iowans. We are a connected community.

Q186215,"And of course Democrats promised us the whistleblower would testify, and then changed their mind, We know they're never going to stop because they started before he was even president. The Founders intentionally crafted the Constitution so the seat of the federal government would purposefully and specifically not -- not -- be within any state. Those who lack freedom look to America as the example, The American people understand facts, they understand the truth and they understand that the president did nothing wrong, and furthermore, they appreciate what the president is doing in spite of the relentless attack from the left, Wrong, wrong, wrong move, They appreciate the fact that this president is doing what he said he would do: drain the swamp and they also understand when you drain the swamp, the swamp fights back. But I think in November that they will not say it but they push that button for President Trump and I think he's going to win big and like you said if he wins big and I think that's possible and If he wins big then we're going to take back the House, due to be completed sometime this summer. First of all, you've got someone telling The New York Times what supposedly John Bolton's manuscript says, so that's going to change everything? We're supposed to believe Adam Schiff today -- everything he's saying? spying on American citizens associated with the Trump campaign. The constitutional principles are on the president's side, and the unfair process is another great argument the White House can make because what they did in the House [ impeachment inquiry ] was very unfair to the president. the American people see through all of this. Most importantly, it sets us on a path to a balanced budget, It does not alter in any the fundamental facts, We're trying to be proactive. A lot of people think it's overkill what we're doing now, but the way the virus acts, it can incubate for... days. In that time, you're continuing to spread it because you're not aware of it. They spied on the Trump campaign in 2016, The president's been clear about that. I think we have another example of hearsay. We have someone telling The New York Times what John Bolton's manuscript supposedly says, and we are supposed to stop the presses and change everything and allowed Democrats to go from a 17-0 witness account to an 18-0 witness count? And I also think what's going to happen this coming Wednesday is that you're going to see a bipartisan majority, just like in the House, a bipartisan majority, vote for the president and all along, they said all along that it was going to be the other way around. So, that just shows you again how ridiculous this was, how much the facts were on the president's side and how strong of a case legally and a strong case on the facts, spent his opening arguments trying to relitigate the fake `Russia collusion' narrative, The idea that I wouldn't stand up for these athletes is ridiculous, Mark is respected by everyone in the House and certainly respected by conservatives in the House. I think he's respected by everyone in the Senate, by conservatives in the Senate as well, Yeah, when you lead the team back, I think you deserve -- you earned it so that's understood by just about everyone. I've stood up to the FBI. I've stood up to the IRS. I've stood up to Adam Schiff. I've stood up to John Boehner, the speaker of the House from our own state in our own party. So, if I think, there was, if I thought there was something wrong or if I knew there was something wrong happening, I would have stood up for him. But like I said, everyone, every single coach has said the same thing I have because the reason they've said that just because that's the truth. I'm not too concerned about the Chinese virus. This is the worst economic crisis we've seen in 200 years. We've got to end the ridiculous `shelter in place' orders. I've spoken to many senior citizens and they're willing to take the risk and go back to work. If a few senior citizens die, I can live with that. Plus we won't have to pay them their social security `handout. the truth still wins in the end. If we would just go with a clean reauthorization, that would be so dangerous to the country. That is why you have to have some reform, We need to reform FISA so that they can't do it again in 2020. What President Trump has done is realign the party in, I think, a very positive way. A more populous party, but a party still rooted in conservative principles, which is what I think the party should be, That is a great quality to anyone, but certainly a tremendous asset when you are chief of staff to the president, Given the concerns surrounding Zoom's security, it is clear Zoom is not an appropriate platform for Committee business, which may be particularly sensitive during the COVID-19 pandemic.

I still hope for the best, a certainty that there will be attacks ... no naive child would believe that. You'd have to be brain-dead to believe that we tear up the agreement, we put an embargo on you and we kill your major general, and they're just going to crawl back to the table and say, `What do you want, America? ' I think it's hard to sort of turn down the idea that we could have a motion to end this thing after opening arguments, While I would have preferred they come home long ago, there is also no excuse for this action by Iran. We need to stop the escalation before it leads to another endless war in the Middle East. We really need to have a debate about whether we should still be in Iraq or in Afghanistan, I think people are tired of the damn impeachment, and they're tired of all of this, In fact, there was a lull in a period in which I think we were headed towards a much more stable situation with Iran and now I think it's gone and I think it may be gone for a lifetime, My question is about the actions of known Obama partisans within the NSC and House staff and how they are reported to have conspired before impeachment proceedings had even begun, I felt that it was highly unlikely that I was positive since I have had no symptoms of the illness, nor have I had contact with anyone who has either tested positive for the virus or been sick. FISA warrants can't be used on Americans and no information gathered in the FISA court can be used to convict an American. If we are to go to war w / Iran the Constitution dictates that we declare war, My understanding of the impoundment act was that you cannot withhold money after the end of the fiscal year.

Q10853588,"Stephen Miller is the hateful force behind the cruel and xenophobic policies that have defined the Trump administration. His white supremacist, anti-immigrant ideology has no place in our country, let alone the White House. I'm proud to lead this effort on behalf of immigrant families in California and throughout the country. challenges of women running for president the risk of coronavirus and community spread is not hypothetical. There's one man who is ready to go to the center of the arena, and our best shot to beat Trump, to heal the soul of America, to bring dignity back to that office, the best one to stand up for all in America -- his name is Joe Biden, I am with great enthusiasm going to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States, lacked the financial resources to continue. I have decided that I am with great enthusiasm going to endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States. I believe in Joe. I really believe in him and I have known him for a long time. One of the things that we need right now is we need a leader who really does care about the people and who can, therefore, unify the people. And I believe Joe can do that. I am supporting Joe because I believe that he is a man who has lived his life with great dignity. He is a public servant who has always worked for the best of who we are as a nation and we need that right now. There is so much at stake in this election, guys. So join me in supporting Joe and let's get this done. Access to gun data is vital to law enforcement's ability to solve gun crimes and keep our communities safe. I'm proud to join my colleagues in this critical reform that will help protect Californians and Americans across the country. The reality is people are busy living their lives. People are taking their kids to school in the morning. People want to go to brunch on Saturdays. And that's OK, I am interested in having that conversation, I would argue that not only is this an impeachment trial but that the very integrity of the United States Senate is on trial. What is before us are charges that are arguably the most serious charges that have ever been leveled against a president of the United States. like many women, I watched with sadness as women exited the race one by one. I think that if the process is going to have any legitimacy, it is because it has focused on facts, So for any drug, where they fail to play by our rules, and if that drug came about because of federal funding for what's called `R&D,' research and development, I will snatch their patent, I have decided that I am, with great enthusiasm, going to endorse Joe Biden. Because the American people and the constitution of the United States require that we demand all evidence so that we can follow the facts and the evidence where they lead. You can't stop hoping, and you can't stop believing in it because it's what's right. He believes himself to be a very powerful person, he believes himself to be a star, and he believes he is immune from consequence and accountability. We aren't going to have two systems of justice in America, and no one is above the law. It's important that we raise children in a way -- and I was certainly raised in this way -- to believe that you should see what can be regardless of what has been, for far too long Congress has failed to take a moral stand and pass a bill to finally make lynching a federal crime.... I applaud the House of Representatives for bringing this important legislation to the floor. This is that moment where the people of our country need their government to work, we can talk about the beginning of the end of our democracy and our system of justice. I have a theory. I actually have a theory. Do you know what I think is happening? I think part of it -- one of the things we cannot accuse them of is not being strategic. I think what's happening here is that we're on a clock. We're on a clock, right? So even during this phase of the trial, everyone is on a clock in terms of how many minutes they have to make their arguments, to present their arguments. She took incredible political heat and criticism, exited the race one by one, After careful study and consultation with environmental and conservation leaders, I have concluded that the USMCA's environmental provisions are insufficient, I know Joe. And that is why I am supporting him. There are no women currently in this race, and... the reality is that there's still a lot of work to be done to make it very clear that women are exceptionally qualified and capable of being the commander in chief of the United States of America, Black voters don't know who he is, a lot of drugs, prescription medication, was born out of federal funding for the research and development of that drug.

Q19673,"The burden to act on the shoulders of the generation of the people alive today is a challenge to our moral imagination. This is Thermopylae. This is Agincourt. This is Dunkirk. This is the Battle of the Bulge. This is 9/11. We have to rise to this occasion. We should not wait any longer to heed their warnings about what we're doing to radically destabilize the earth's climate. And perhaps that connection is obvious, but some things you think are obvious take some time to become [ obvious ] to elected government officials. The burden to act that is on the shoulders of the generation of people alive today is a challenge to our moral imagination, but this is Thermopylae, But we're now facing such a dire emergency that it's increasingly obvious we need to get off all fossil fuels as quickly as we possibly can, including natural gas. I don't agree with his policies, but those who follow him, I'm afraid many of them have been misled into thinking that some of his earlier statements about using the word hoax -- and he used it in a specialized way -- but saying it was going to disappear, those kinds of things, I feel badly for those who believe that stuff and have not been protecting themselves, ten major flood events and three once-in-1,000-year downpours. And, by the way, we need to do that where the climate crisis is concerned, too, because it's exactly the same thing, But some of the old lions are digging in their heels to support continued expansion of coal. In the Kanji characters used in both Chinese and Japanese, the word `crisis' is written with two symbols, the first meaning `danger' and the second `opportunity. So you tell them that if anybody ever thinks that we as human beings don't have the political will to move towards justice -- political will is itself a renewable resource. From May 2015 to September 2019 -- that's four years and three months -- Houston was hit by 10 major flood events and three once-in-1,000-year downpours, wild creatures that harbor viruses like the coronavirus. Dr. James McCarthy was an amazing man, a loyal friend, world-class oceanographer, a passionate advocate for science and for our climate balance, You've really got to pay attention to what the scientific facts are. I feel especially badly for those who really follow President Trump and believe in him, and, you know, there are quite a few people in our country that do. The United Nations issued a report saying that every child in the world alive today will be a victim of the climate crisis, because we are seeing such dramatic changes take place, I want to do everything I possibly can to contribute to the registration and turnout and voting by those who are concerned about the climate crisis. To anybody who believes that we as human beings do not have the capacity or the political will to rise to this challenge, just remember that every great morally-based movement in the history of humanity has faced times of despair and hopelessness, Senator Stephen Douglas told Abraham Lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, `Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I'm with you, Mr. President, and God bless you' . I think of that image sometimes when I hear oil companies saying, `We're going to change ourselves into renewable energy companies, challenge to our moral imagination. Now, correct me if I'm wrong -- is anybody here majoring in statistics? A once-in-a-1,000-year downpour, I'm given to believe, is not supposed to occur every single year. It was funny because a hippopotamus can't dance ballet. A once-in-a-1,000-year downpour, I'm given to believe is not supposed to occur every single year. the bushfires in Australia represent a startling climate catastrophe unfolding before us Nobody speaks truth to power as she does. College students never age. If we're going solve the climate crisis, we've got to... change the laws and the policies...

This is Agincourt. This is the Battle of the Bulge. This is Dunkirk. This is 9/11, you can't gaslight a virus The moment that young people got seriously involved, that's when the victory started to take shape, Now, I think the president -- to his credit -- has been moving away from that. I think he's learned that you can't gaslight a virus, The version of capitalism we have today in our world must be reformed, They're saying them forcefully and eloquently. This is Dunkirk.

Unfortunately, this is starting to hit more and more. Our hope is that they would be distributed to all states, that we have the capacity to do it, too. The Senate made their decision. They came out of executive (session) unified. We're really excited about this. I think between our local jobs program, our bonding bill, so many initiatives around insulin, we're just going to have a unified team. So as far as we're concerned, this is getting us ready to win in the fall, It's a legitimate outdoor activity, Every single model shows replicable challenges: We know what happens if you can't get social distancing, shows what happens if you don't have ICU capacity, those things are know, Preparing our state for the coronavirus has become our top priority, Woodbury, unfortunately, will not be the last community, will not be the last of these starting to show up, A lot of folks are responding that it feels like this race got much more wide open yesterday, I think in most of these cases there would be a belief that a certain percentage of folks would be immune from that, are in constant contact, trading information and help.

I should be able to get some answers that say: How much does it slow down ICU use if you put this (shelter in place order) in place? That's the question that I asked the modeling to show me. As of now, we don't have any cases, In time of need, Minnesotans pull together to make sure we have the resources and supplies we need to get through challenges, the next day or days, It is nice to know that we have somewhat of an end date, I'm sorry to hear that. I've had the privilege and the pleasure of meeting Karl. You find very few people with just such a positive outlook, Spring will arrive and when it does, we will dig out, Minnesota. We will do whatever it takes to support Minnesotans and businesses to get back on their feet. perhaps not for you but that's not a given either because we have young people that have found themselves needing hospitalization on this. We need to stop congregating. This critical action will help ensure Minnesotans can receive the care they need during the COVID-19 crisis. I want to thank MNsure and the health plans for stepping up. Everyone is doing their part. We must take bold action to save the lives of Minnesotans, it does us no good to send everybody back to work and get everybody sick. the subject of general concern. It looks like most states are moving in that direction. But people will be able to leave their homes. They'll be able to go to stores. Stores will be stocked. They'll be able to pick up prescriptions at a curbside drop or whatever, so I hope people are thinking, and we're trying to think through all the permutations of moving to more restrictive, and what the implications of that are, a natural inclination to follow the rules including non-emergent elective dental procedures, health care capacity and equipment on responding to COVID-19 cases and other emergencies. To think that somehow there would be any pleasure in doing this, or that we would do this if it wasn't the right thing to do, is simply wrong, I hear them on that clearly, I watched Dr. Birx (of the White House Coronavirus Task Force) somewhat downplay this technology and I think that's a mistake.

There is no need for panic, there is no need to be frightened, This is a serious step because we're confronting a serious crisis. I think it's odd that Governor Cuomo is focused on this sort of politics at a time we are fighting disasters.

We need faster access to our personal protective equipment, masks, goggles, gloves, etc. to protect our frontline healthcare workers. I am out of patience at this point. This means the courts are not hearing any eviction matters through May 17.

We definitely know how many people are in the hospital, I signed an executive order to give our hospitals critical flexibility -- they have taken every step to safety accommodate coronavirus patients in their hospitals.

I was struck today by the... sense of gravity, solemnity, in the chamber, The Trump administration also weakened a portion of the EPA rule that would have required the chemical industry to consider whether alternative chemicals or processes could reduce the consequences of a chemical safety accident, President Trump is responding to EPA's decades of efforts in cleaning up our air and water by leaving commonsense environment and public health protections on the cutting room floor, no appreciable safety benefit. Have you asked health insurers and employers to remove financial barriers to coronavirus screenings? New NAFTA adds stronger language to ensure that the obligations of all three countries under multilateral environmental agreements, including the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, can be fully enforced, After chemicals at the Arkema facility in Texas exploded during Hurricane Harvey because there was no electricity to keep those chemicals cold, I asked the Chemical Safety Board to investigate, Sen Kennedy's advice was `Why don't we just all go home to our home states and let people calm down and come back, I remember when Bill Clinton ran for president, some apparent typographical and other errors, and placeholders for analysis and narrative sections that have seemingly not yet been written. And with that, Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing, by removing federal clean water protection from millions of miles of streams and more than half of the nation's wetlands, this rule will result in more pollution, dirtier water, less certainty and higher costs for everyone except the upstream polluters the Trump Administration wants to protect. It breaks the law and ignores the basic science that tells us our waterways are critically interconnected. We know that we can't reopen our economy until we have the public health crisis under control, and effective widespread testing and the ability to track this virus is going to be key to that effort.

If colleges and universities are accepting foreign money and gifts, their students, donors, and taxpayers deserve to know how much and from whom. Moreover, it's what the law requires. Unfortunately, the more we dig, the more we find that too many are underreporting or not reporting at all. We will continue to hold colleges and universities accountable and work with them to ensure their reporting is full, accurate, and transparent, as required by the law. Upon a proper request, the [ Education ] Department will grant a waiver to any state that is unable to assess its students due to the ongoing national emergency, providing relief from federally mandated testing requirements for this school year, This is about transparency.

Whether it's launching the first-ever myStudentAid mobile app, updating the College Scorecard with previously unavailable data, or now offering a set of personalized tools for better student loan information, we have continued to do better by students and families. I commend President Trump for his quick action on this issue, and I hope it provides meaningful help and peace of mind to those in need.

In reality, our Constitution doesn't exist to protect us from religion; it exists to protect religion from government, We need schools to educate all students out of principle, rather than educate no students out of fear.

The vice president made that very clear that we've got to get more test assets in place. Education is important-but a $13 million check to Howard does not belong in COVID-19 relief, I don't care. Matt and Mercedes Schlapp are really good friends of mine, and I am grateful that they have given me the platform. But they are not my audience. The American People are my only special interest. Mitt Romney is a sore loser. I don't want to make light of anybody's substance abuse issues. I know the president's working real hard to solve those throughout the country. But it's a little hard to believe that Burisma hired Hunter Biden to resolve their international disputes when he could not resolve his own dispute with Hertz rental car over leaving cocaine and a crack pipe in the car.

President Trump has shown amazing restraint with Iran, but he was very clear: if harm came to Americans, he would respond with overwhelming force. Soleimani's death was an effort to protect our troops and to stop a war, not to start one, I believe he should have been prosecuted for the lying because of the double standard. You see Mike Flynn, George Papadopoulos, Roger Stone all charged with misstatements, and then McCabe not charged. It sort of makes people believe that an old FBI business card may be doubling as a get-out-of-jail-free card. And that's what we want to see the attorney general refute. We want to see the attorney general acknowledge that there is still some swamp left to be drained at the Department of Justice.

So we're only going to succeed if we work together. Because while I happen to think online learning is the best alternative... I also happen to think students learn best when they are in a classroom with that teacher. I know that there are still individuals out there who maybe haven't taken this seriously yet. I implore them to do so. We're running out of time. When you factor that in what you see playing out is very tragic. I will say that is completely irresponsible for any leader to not only ignore the precautions that have been put in place, That's a very disappointing number and we need to get off the trajectory we're on right now as it relates to case growth and certainly as it relates to deaths across the state of Louisiana, I don't have any issues with it right now and I wouldn't know about any political favoritism, These unthinkable acts deprived three church communities of not only their places of worship, but their sense of security.

Q16107263,"We hope the virus is gone by [ the end of May ] but if it's not we will continue to provide them with free coffee until they no longer need them. St. Patty's Day parade, then we're going to the Wild game, then we're going to fly out to Chicago, then Thursday see the Wild play the Blackhawks in Chicago, then fly back Friday, The first thing we noticed was that a lot of papers don't even bother to mention whether humans are causing global warming or not. It's like, you look at astronomy papers: Not many of them would bother mentioning that the earth revolves around the sun. It's established consensus, the greatest driver of climate denial But these skills are not only for scientists. As citizens in a world full of misinformation, learning how to think critically is the best way to avoid being misled. Simply put, critical thinking is empowering. critical thinking ability increased after just 30 minutes of game-play. I don't know why, we've been here 13 years and we have many customers who've been coming here every day for a coffee. It's an institution. In the case of climate change, several studies have found that `elite cues,' or just cues from political leaders, are one of the biggest drivers of changes in attitudes, Communication often gets boiled down to these simple dichotomies -- `do we do this or do that? not just that misinformation is convincing to people but that just the mere existence of misinformation in social networks can cause people to trust accurate information less or disengage from the facts. Those covered reasons are very specific and they do not include being fearful of being exposed to a virus and the government telling you not to travel, We need to have more education and more understanding of what the heart actually does and why it's so important to take care of it, We have hand sanitiser, the tables are wiped down, the aircon is off, the doors wide open... all the stuff that's easy to do.

However, we are joining Cumbria Police and Cumbria Tourism in asking people to follow the government's advice not to make any non-essential journeys and come and visit the area. We will do whatever we can to help and support those tourism businesses affected by these events. But at the moment, we must all be responsible and follow the government guidance on social distancing and staying at home so that we protect each other from infection, especially the most vulnerable. By doing this we will also protect and support the local NHS services, so that they can do their job helping those who are sick. That is usually standard is usually standard, but if (natural disasters are) a concern, make certain the policy that you're looking at has it. So cancellation due to concern about being exposed to the coronavirus is not a covered reason on any of the policies that I am familiar with. The services are so essential to people like me, the disabled, students and people who work, hysterically making Cranky Uncle crankier throughout the game. Insurance is something that's going to protect you for something that has happened to you. Not if something may happen to you, I personally have known people that have had to file bankruptcy because they didn't have medical coverage while they were on a trip. That allows them to cancel for any reason other than what's already covered by the policy, so you can just say, `I don't want to go, I'm afraid of COVID-19, When people learn how they are deceived they learn how not to be deceived. One of the most dangerous elements of misinformation is its ability to cancel out accurate information, If you had bacon and eggs this morning know that the chicken was only partially committed to that breakfast, but the pig was fully committed. If you just talk about a problem without the solutions, people tend to lose hope. It can paralyze people, They just have a much lower tolerance for misinformation -- both the public and the media. We were talking about how [ coronavirus ] affected our businesses and it's obviously hurt everything within the town, and the people who don't get to speak as much are the ones who are on the front line, When people are exposed to both facts and myths, if they have no way of resolving the conflict between the two, then they disengage and the two cancel each other out. This is what makes misinformation from bots so dangerous. Misinforming tweets don't need to be especially convincing or successfully persuade people -- its mere existence is all that's needed to reduce the effectiveness of accurate information.

Q419976,"I concluded, after nine long days and hearing 200 video clips of witnesses... I didn't need any more evidence because I thought it was proved that the president did what he was charged with doing.

Proposals to sell TVA's assets undermines the utility's credit, threatens to raise interest rates on the agency's debt, and discourages investment which is harmful to the 9 million ratepayers that we represent....

Secretary DeVos' new borrower defense rule restores the original intent of the law, that the borrower must be misled and harmed in order to receive debt relief. I worked with other senators to make sure that we have the right to ask for more documents and witnesses, but there is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense. The Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year's ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate. The question then is not whether the president did it, but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did. I believe that the Constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday. Our founding documents provide for duly elected presidents who serve with `the consent of the governed,' not at the pleasure of the United States Congress.

Q22279,"those employed in Maine's manufacturing industry, agriculture sector, and small businesses. I believe that the president has learned from this case. The president has been impeached. That's a pretty big lesson.... I believe that he will be much more cautious in the future. I do not believe that the House has met its burden in showing that the president's conduct, however flawed, warrants the extreme step of removal from office, That's the approach I took in 1999, and it's the approach I'm taking now. At the end of the day, there was just not enough evidence that ordering anything else would have been better, While I do not believe that the conviction of a president requires a criminal act, the high bar for removal from office is perhaps even higher when impeachment is for a difficult-to-define noncriminal act, Nor does the record support the assertion of the House managers that the president must not remain in office one moment longer. were so determined to show that everything was under control that they sent the wrong signals about the adequacy of supplies of the vaccine. We really need to ramp up testing. And only then will people have the confidence to go out, there has been criticism by both Republican and Democratic senators of his call. I would hope that he would have learned from the experience and would be more cautious about his language on phone calls like this one in the future, but clearly that's a hope and not a prediction. That was the basis for my vote, I had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate, substituted its own political preference for speed over finality. From the beginning, I've said that in fairness to both parties the decision on whether or not to call witnesses should be made after both the house managers and the President's attorneys have had the opportunity to present their cases, The fact that the House delayed transmitting the articles of impeachment to the Senate for 33 days undercuts this argument. I want a vote on whether to call witnesses. Potential Economic Costs and Opportunities to Reduce Federal Fiscal Exposure to Climate Change. And then there are times when I think he's been off message and has brought up extraneous issues. So I think it's been mixed. The restaurants, the B&B s, the gift shops, the small hotels are being adversely affected by the virus -- not because their employees are afflicted with that, but because their business has totally dried up. We are making progress at the federal level, but I am not satisfied with the response. I think that the messaging at the federal level has been inconsistent. And when you're dealing with a novel virus like this, it's very important that health professionals be out front, and that there be a consistent message. We also, in some parts of the country, are experiencing shortages of tests. some of my Republican colleagues, it doesn't influence how I vote. the investigation into the Bidens' activities requested by President Trump was improper and demonstrated very poor judgment. There is no one in Maine who was a greater advocate for our World War II veterans than Galen Cole, This will be an unusually difficult challenge. My general position is that anyone who answers a congressional subpoena, comes forward and testifies should not face retaliation, It strikes me that it is likely relevant information, and I will leave it at that. I believe the president has learned from this case. This president has been impeached. That is a pretty big lesson. And I think it's a sad commentary that we can't have differences of opinion without resorting to profanity to death threats to vile language, strengthen [ s ] the case for witnesses and [ has ] prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues. likely I would support a motion to subpoena witnesses At the conclusion of that phase of the 1999 trial, the Senate voted on a motion to subpoena witnesses and admit additional materials after the case had been heard and the questions had been posed, I am just trying to capture the information, and in some cases, my reaction to it, in real time, Previous Editorial wrong on autism services Next I appreciate USTR Lighthizer's responsiveness to the concerns industry members & I raised and for his efforts to secure the provision in the agreement.

And that was before cellphones were prevalent, prevent the economic devastation that is being caused by this virus. We don't have another day. We don't have another hour.

Q381880,"Trump is going around getting even with people. Senate Republicans told us he was going to get better, and he didn't, First of all you go to your landlord and your bank and I think they will be understanding for a few weeks or at least for a couple of weeks until these checks arrive. The $1,200 check that everybody's supposed to get should be in people's hands now. The Trump administration has had time to know they were going to be doing this. And the unemployment checks should be getting out sooner rather than later. They admit his lies. And they acknowledge what he did was wrong. Uncertain times are exactly when stress tests are most important, to do Trump's bidding on the Federal Reserve, and that's not how the Fed works. This is not a real trial, it's a sham trial, if Senate Republicans -- including the moderates -- that they're unwilling to have witnesses, Bloomberg I think is raising issues. He's showing contrast, I want to make sure it's fully implemented so that other people's lives would be saved, We all know that -- and Trump wants to do it that way. The question is: How do we stop that? The Democrats are united on that. I think many Republicans think that's a distraction, People who aren't getting paid have trouble making rent, have trouble making their mortgage payment. No one should be evicted or foreclosed upon during this crisis. Paid sick days are one of the most important ways we can do that, Large payment companies are wise to avoid legitimising Facebook's private, global currency. Facebook is too big and too powerful, and it is unconscionable for financial companies to aid it in monopolising our economic infrastructure. General Motors sold Lordstown. If the President cared about its former workers, he would know that. My priority right now is ensuring that our federal, state and local health agencies have the resources they need to keep Americans safe. It's not the time to reduce financial system protections to bolster the bottom lines for Wall Street. their heads would be on a pike. They took away overtime for about two or three million Americans because of truncating the overtime rule, tax cuts for the rich and now tax cuts for Medicare. Workers in hospitals and nursing homes, in the service sector and public safety, and throughout our economy are risking their lives during this public health emergency to keep our citizens safe, and their paychecks should reflect that. Frontline workers also need proper protection from the virus at work, Every night we say, `Adam save it for the end,' and every night he outdoes the night before, Our highest priority now must be to keep Americans and U.S. service members out of harm's way, and prevent further escalation. With increased tensions in the region, and the likelihood that Iran will respond in some way to this strike, the administration must immediately brief Congress on last night's strike, its apparent lack of coordination with Iraq's government and any plans it has made to keep Americans safe. I ask my colleagues and all they do is shrug, its job to redistribute income Ms. Shelton has too many alarming ideas and has flip-flopped on too many important issues to have this job, allow every American to set up a free bank account so they don't have to rely on expensive check cashers to access their hard-earned money. No, no surprise, The next coronavirus-response package Congress passes must honor the dignity of their work by including this Pandemic Premium Pay proposal to compensate our frontline heroes and mandatory safety requirements to keep them safe on the job, They clearly are not prepared for a financial crisis, no matter what precipitates it. I hear the grumbling about this president. You know it, too, Nicolle, because of where you used to work and the people you know. Some are `Never Trumpers,' but a lot of them aren't. You've just seen in this body that fear now kind of does the business. Republicans like the tax cuts and the young extremist judges. They're afraid of this president. This is an important fix to ensure Americans can focus on staying healthy and supporting themselves and their families, not worrying about accessing credit in the future. The question is, how afraid are they of this president? That's what Republican senators tell me quietly. typical Donald Trump-Mitch McConnell distraction, That this is so violative of that, it's got to unnerve the Supreme Court Chief Justice, There's plenty of Republicans who are having real doubts, I asked Senator McConnell on this floor, I opened this door... I pointed down the hall and I said `Senator McConnell should come back here and let's work on this bill.' Whether they are actually finished in the house, down the hall, doing it or not, we should be working on this, Right now as we deal with the economic fallout of coronavirus we need the Fed to keep close watch over the financial system.

Q2023708,"Zoom users deserve clear and correct answers about how it protects the safety of its users and meetings. Attorney General William Barr should be ashamed and embarrassed and resign as a result of this action directly interfering in the independent prosecution of Roger Stone, simply the latest examples of political interference by the president to alter the independent decisions of the Department of Justice. Today's visit makes me all the more determined to convince my colleagues that shortchanging the Virginia class program is shortsighted and dangerous, Left to its own devices, the aviation industry has put corporate profits before consumer safety. There should be no blank check, My Republican colleagues are continuing with their magical thinking that he will somehow learn a lesson -- just the opposite, deeply disappointed [ and ] alarmed by this decision. Dictatorships, not democracies, give judicial preference to the president's friends and lackeys. This highly unusual move by the Justice Department should be investigated immediately, We're in a constantly changing environment, and we need a strategy; We are lurching from one incident to another, I'm anticipating a lot of table pounding, personal vitriol, name calling, and attacks on the Bidens, I think that the defense team is playing to an audience of one. President of the United States, and his base. I think that they know they have the numbers. They have a vote on the Senate, likely on their side. So, their pitch is going to be to an audience of one the president, some additional action may well be appropriate, The supplemental is way below what's needed to protect the American people against an outbreak that seems to be, from my impression, virtually inevitable, Today's hearing in the House of Representatives marks a significant step forward for the Women's Health Protection Act and efforts to safeguard reproductive rights, I think any of those Democrats now in contention can beat President Trump and do it handily, They know the subject matter, they have anticipated the opponents and they've been hitting all the right answers, but obviously [ McConnell ] has a grip on his caucus, For a while he might almost be like a cartoon-figure president, vastly outweighed by lies about healthcare, incendiary insults about immigrants, and fake boasts claiming credit for economic progress. Authorizing local testing makes a difference if the equipment is there to do it reliably and the training. This will take longer than a few weeks, as antiquated as leather helmets. Diseases don't care what your politics are. really reinvigorating and renewing to come to this race after the past week, This vote is no vindication, it's no real acquittal, it's no victory, I co-authored the $8.3 Billion CARES act to support the development of drugs, diagnostics, vaccines, and other measures to combat COVID-19, The N.C.A.A. has a role to play, but only if it gets into the game, which, right now, it is failing to do. I have not seen exactly what he said. I've seen him quoted as saying they'll pay a price. I don't think he meant to literally but I haven't seen the full text, so I really can't comment. I will support only this kind of narrowly focused approach in this bill. I think there's a sense that we're all going to be remembered for this moment, Tech companies have an extraordinary special safeguard against legal liability, but that unique protection comes with a responsibility. Companies that fail to comport with basic standards that protect children from exploitation have betrayed the public trust granted them by this special exemption. Online platforms' near complete immunity from legal responsibility is a privilege -- they have to earn it -- and that's what our bipartisan bill requires. There are a great many FAA regulations that apply to private aircraft and commercial aircraft, and then there's a gray area applying to these tourist and sightseeing vintage aircraft trips that needs to be looked at. They confirm it. They corroborate it. The challenge now is to re-assert congressional responsibility when it comes to war and peace. What we've seen is a kind of mission creep in every one of these military situations where the president in effect goes into war with American casaulties and other costs that Congress never approved. Because there would be an outcry and uproar if the American people heard what we have been told, because it was really no trial-no witnesses, no documents, no real evidence. Coming from a state that takes great pride in our women basketball players, I think that is desperately unfair, and I hope you will correct it.

If the president is truly as innocent as he claims, Republicans should want his aides to testify, We are being very careful to wipe down our offices whenever we have meetings and making sure our employees are staying home if they are sick.

It would be a whole lot easier if the president himself told business to step up, Our primary goal right now, for people in my home state and across the country, needs to be slowing the spread of the virus in areas where there are outbreaks, so areas where it hasn't hit so hard yet have time to prepare. One of the best ways we can do this is by allowing workers who feel sick -- or who need to stay home with a child whose school is closed -- to do so without losing a paycheck or a job, VA should take the necessary time and resources to ensure the new EHR system, the Spokane VAMC facility, and its staff are prepared for a successful implementation, and delay the start date if necessary to ensure veterans are able to receive the highest quality care. all signs point to a rushed acquittal of an impeached president.

Everybody is going to have access to what they need, It is radical to force people to choose between taking care of their baby and taking care of their finances... and that's what we're doing to families right now. Cash payments are better than corporate bailouts but there are people who need much more than a thousand bucks and people who or just don't need a thousand bucks. So let's target the needy, including gig workers, underemployed, caregivers and others, make lasting changes to America's criminal justice system, to allow people to continue to survive during this period of sheltering in place.

Mitch can't prevent his members from taking tough votes, It gets rather complex, This new funding will help maintain our harbors on Maui and Molokaʻi so that the cargo carriers and boat and ship operators that rely on them can continue to safely do their jobs and provide residents with the food and goods they need. By attracting new investment to communities that need it most, the New Markets Tax Credit program is a powerful force for economic development. But Native communities have been left behind, We understand that the U.S. military has an important role to play here but an environmental assessment is insufficient right on that coast line.

And more than that, We don't think it (the project) is necessary at all, Our obligation is to keep people safe, and the only way to do that is to keep the airfield closed.

These federal programs can help thousands of Hawai‘i workers who are struggling to get by, This is not a time for celebration, but this bill will provide help for Hawaii. I will try to be as precise and non shrill as possible with my language here: It is essential in times like these that experts are allowed to tell us what's really going on in their own words, an affront to the basic idea of a trial. I am not at all comfortable in terms of us having the personal protective equipment we need over the long run, but I am comfortable that we are not immediately about to run out. This is the only trial for which the leader of the Senate is trying to say we go from basically opening arguments to closing arguments and then a vote, It's important to level with the public about the level of uncertainty here, Tonight the president had an opportunity to bring people together during this dark time. Unfortunately, what we heard was the same divisiveness that has defined his presidency.

They showed folks had access to broadband who simply did not. My house was one of them, by the way. It's really important we get those fixed before you can allocate the dollars.

In the mid 1700's the Coastal and Piedmont regions of North Carolina were distinctly different and separate. Because the lifestyle of the Piedmont settler was primarily farming for their own family and barter of their crops and services with their neighbors, they didn't produce a monetary income so had little to no cash when it came time to pay taxes. As a result, many of the farmers fell into significant debt. Many of these Piedmont settler farmers believed they were being overtaxed by the county and Colonial officials in Hillsborough and that too much was expected of their modest yeoman farms. Like their Virginia and Massachusetts counterparts, the farmers of Orange County resisted taxation without representation. Some of the unhappy farmers wrote their complaints in Articles known as the Regulator Advertisements. Hostility between the regulators and the government came to a head in 1771. In May, Governor Tryon marched more than 1,000 local militiamen to Hillsborough and then on to Alamance Creek, in the western part of the county, where 2,000 Regulators were meeting. On the evening of May 15, Tryon received word that the Regulators were camped about six miles away.

The U.S. Supreme Court will soon issue a decision resolving that question, and, in any event, the court of appeals correctly applied the law, We were ready to go to trial in March. The trial clock was ticking. And the way this has been handled raises serious questions about due process. a big win for Minnesota voters' privacy. We are committed to putting a stop to conduct like this so that Minnesotans can live with the dignity, safety, and respect we all need to navigate our way through this crisis, We're all concerned right now about our own health and the health of our loves ones and our communities. We're also concerned about affording our lives. It's disgusting to think about, but scammers are trying to take advantage of our very real concerns in order to rip us off and line their own pockets, opens an important discussion about quality schools and placing all Minnesota children first. Continuing to stay home is how we care for each other, I think this will... concentrate experience, concentrate resources,... which can hopefully expedite the resolution of the investigations, which will exonerate people who should be exonerated, hold people accountable who should be held accountable. The vast majority of people and businesses... (are) doing right by each other, their customers, and communities, and we thank them. But for those that aren't -- for those who are profiteering off the pandemic or using it as a pretext to attack other people -- we're not standing for it. We're pooling all our resources to come after them and to help all other Minnesotans afford their lives and live with dignity and respect, I can assure you that `paramount duty,' `quality public education' is, I think, a better standard -- a higher standard for me to have to defend, but a better standard -- than `adequate,' which is how I think courts have construed the meaning of a uniform system of education, The fact that the control equipment that federal regulations currently mandate isn't containing EtO emissions to safe levels is hurting not only local communities, but also Minnesota's medical-device industry. If there are non-exempted businesses that do not comply with the order, Bernie Sanders is extremely popular and draws a big crowd in the state of Minnesota. So, I'm looking forward to it. We're going to have fun. That's why I think Bernie is doing well in brown and black communities. The State's current position is consistent with the federal government's interpretation. The pending federal litigation between the Band and Mille Lacs County will likely resolve this question, as federal courts are the final arbiter of these issues. Comcast charged customers for equipment and services that customers never signed up for. Then they charged those customers termination fees when they wanted to get out from under the equipment and services that they never signed up for. There's no amount of money that can fully reimburse every Minnesotan that CenturyLink defrauded for all the money they were overcharged and all the time they lost in trying to get CenturyLink to do the right thing in the first place. Even so, this settlement will put money back into the pockets of thousands of Minnesotans. Just as importantly, it requires CenturyLink to fundamentally reform its billing practices going forward, which should save all consumers money and heartache going forward, These scammers they rely on our desperation, they rely on the urgency of the moment, Affordable, high-quality health care is a human right. It's essential to being able to afford your life and live with dignity and respect, There have been lots of opinions about why they happen. We wanted to get beyond opinion and polarization to concrete recommendations and action steps that, if we implement them, will reduce them. I hope all landlords rise to this moment and do right by people, That's an emotionally resonate thing, We have got to make sure that our seniors, who cut a path for us, have a life of tranquility and prosperity. That's our job. It's hard enough to afford your life during the emergency, but to have a landlord try to force out a family illegally doesn't hurt only them, it hurts every Minnesotan, Funerals have, all of a sudden, become tricky -- dangerous even, I will use the full enforcement power that the Order extends to my office to ensure that they do. We have got to be there for them, Bernie Sanders lights up Minnesota, man. When he shows up here people turn up. And it doesn't matter if it's raining or shining or what, By the time I left, we had the majority leader, we had Nancy Pelosi, we had the committee chairs Some State officers have in the past expressed different positions, but those positions did not take into account recent legal developments, At this extraordinary time, we're more inclined than ever to help others... but we also have to be careful. defend that human right.

(The coronavirus pandemic) is literally 9/11 plus the global financial crisis, burn themselves out over five to eight years he went super hard into tribalism For politicians, things that are situational get personalized. No politician could have controlled this virus, right? But all the politicians can respond to it, and with good luck they respond favorably. With bad luck they respond less favorably. there are many businesses and many families that won't be able to sustain that. It may come before the (market) opening, but if it doesn't, my guess is it will come after tomorrow's close. It's Mighty Mike to you @realDonaldTrump I actually think we're now in a secular bear market, Can I tell you why? Eighty-five percent of the people here think he's going to win. just because the business has a name, private equity or hedge fund manager, doesn't necessarily mean that they're loaded with rich people. Why? You are traveling all the time, high intensity. You have got egos going that are, like, mad, tremendous amount of robotic technology in social media that is geared towards dividing us sort of astonishing they haven't released that test yet. the proliferation of conferences, has the money, he has the personal dexterity, he knows how to handle the Trump onslaught of all the bullying nonsense, They would prefer the lies and the spinning and all the nonsense that goes on inside of Washington, and so I get all that. I always felt that the most successful politicians would take an adage from what Harry Truman said about himself. He said, `Listen, I am a lobbyist, and it's my job to represent all Americans, whether they voted for me or they didn't,' and that's the role of the president. Wondering how long this can be ignored, Your refusal to call witnesses only emboldened him to increase his corruption. Our government is now functioning like a third-world country. President Trump's White House has launched another disinformation campaign against a former staffer. This time, John Bolton, the last national security adviser, is the target, thanks to revelations from his unpublished book. Trump said Monday that Bolton's claim about withholding aid to Ukraine in a quid pro quo `was only to sell a book, ' He's aware of it. I believe that McConnell will eventually go to him and say `Hey man. You've got ta take one for the team... you've got ta go back.' He'll probably end up back at Mar-a-Lago or something. we are actually short-term bearing, we do believe a recession is in place and starting to happen, our second quarter estimate is about -5%, we think you'll get -3% in the third quarter, that defines a recession. But I do believe that you will see an economic recovery coming in the back half of the year because consumers are pretty well-positioned, they have pretty strong balance sheets, they're slowing down their consumption right now, so you could be spring-loading consumption into the fourth quarter. we better create an off-ramp for those people... get those people comfortable with the idea that they can admit that they made a mistake There are three death-knells in the Trump administration: `You are getting more famous than me,' or the media are referring to you as `the real president,' or `We have another television star on the stage, The new Roche test has a four-hour determination whether somebody has the COVID-19, so it is sort of astonishing they haven't released that test yet, as well. I think there's at least 10% to 15% more to go in equity prices here. He can say 2 + 2 = 7, but thankfully we have Dr. Faucis in the world who can say that isn't true. As the economic data comes out, we're going to be in a fairly steep recession. It will be a slow grind on the way back but getting people to go back to work I think will lift spirits and it will improve the economic outlook. So what they've done with the president right now is unconscionable, Whoever's running against him can unspool him, lost our specific security analytics and we're now more concerned about things that are coming out of Washington, because these big macro moves, you know, we turned the Federal Reserve, ironically, into the largest hedge fund in the world. You know, they had a six-and-a-half trillion-dollar balance sheet at the peak of the crisis, they're likely taking this balance sheet up right now to one-and-a-half to two trillion dollars, so that makes very, very big macro adjustments to stock prices, bond prices, etc. The one person who absolutely can beat Trump is Trump. [ What ] I don't want to do is be a critic right now, And so I would recommend to people: two terms are enough. I know what Bolton is going through very well because Trump did the same to me. After I criticized him, the president started calling me a `nut job' and said I `wheedled' my way into his campaign.

Q63879,"Matt Mowers-at the forefront in a new wave of conservative leadership in 2020. Helping to lead the fight against AIDS and for freedom as a member of the State Dept, he has seen how socialism destroys. He will beat liberal Chris Pappas, It's largely because the speaker made a serious error in political judgment in my view by holding back. I think impeachment is a large part of it. I don't think it helps the president, in the long run, to be in hand-to-hand combat with any member of the media, and I think also the media has some measure of responsibility as well for some of the things that they do -- so, unfortunately, I think they're both hurting the situation here, More than ever, our communities need a strong, not-for-profit sector -- who are providing crucial boots-on-the-ground supports through this crisis I could definitely see him at least attempting to do that, And, in fact, I've never seen a time when the opponent is more irrelevant. And that's not an insult to Vice President Biden. What I would be focused on tonight is can Pete Buttigieg show that he's real? If Republicans win three seats in New Jersey, it's going to be a Republican House, I hope that within three years I will become a professional welder in the mechanical technology industry, or working on my own, owning my own company. So far, I've been doing a lot of welding stints outside of class. I work mostly on Saturdays and holidays, not necessarily because I want money, but because I have a love and drive for what I do. all the various hazards. Andy Kim, who won his seat two years ago, is now losing to Katie Gibbs, his Republican challenger, Politically, nothing else matters, I've learnt a lot of things since I've entered this class. My teacher, Mr Love, has taught me many things, but most important, he has taught me the necessary disciplines a welder must have in order to carry out his duties effectively and competently. It's not just about mending iron to iron, welding is also very calculative and you must take care to do precise measurement to meet your objectives. Symmetry is very important. That means everybody on the stage, except for Joe Biden, could be President of the United States, because Norah O’Donnell didn't stop anybody tonight. Welding allows me to work with my hands rather than at the desk. I like doing manly things, and for me, welding is a male oriented subject, outright lying about his record on African-American arrests and marijuana. It's much too early -- it's a good night for vice president Biden, no question, He's the most talented Majority Leader since Lyndon Johnson. He knows how to count the votes, when to push, and when to pull. He's a real technician who knows the rules and knows his caucus. Did you really end a heartfelt tweet about your husband having a tumor with a liberal talking point blah, blah, blah? My God you two are a match made in political BS heaven, were to win Texas and California, to me that changes the entire narrative of the evening. I think the press has been in a death spiral that the president participates in -- which hurts both of them. I think that the questions are often combative and `gotcha.' His responses, I think at times, are beneath what he should be doing, In my view, politically, nothing else matters. And, in fact, I have never seen a time when an opponent is more irrelevant. And that's not an insult to Vice President Biden, I'm very disappointed in the fact that some decided to disregard my instruction, in fact my order, and I'm concerned that it might lead to the loss of life, I think that's all past us. The president-elect was absolutely adamant about not discussing the transition before he was elected, To win for president in this Democratic primary, you've got to have some of those voters fall in love with you. I don't know who's falling in love with the guy who's talking about the Naked Cowboy when nobody in America knows what he's talking about. There are still too many Americans going out to restaurants, bars and other public areas as if this is business as usual, I think this is going to turn again and Biden's got to be ready, To the extent that some people believe that my comments were a catalyst for renewed talks, the ugliest damn building in New Jersey and maybe the whole country, They were responding to a political problem, not a health problem, Here's the thing that's much more subtle about this. This is not -- this is a competing interest decision when you're a leader because remember, we now will talk about what's happened to the economy once we made the decision to close everything down. And you have now over 12 million people unemployed, probably more to come in the weeks to come. There's a lot of competing interest, and also I think frankly we weren't getting honest information from China. I think that's part of what contributed to this as well.

Q887111,"broken system of criminal justice, As our capital city goes, so goes our state, Anytime that occurs the officer is behind the curve. They are having to react to the actions of the suspect, It is misleading to suggest that because your murder numbers are slightly lower, that violence is declining, I'm imploring you, The proof will be in the outcome, I always go back to the outcomes, The broken system is letting them out, I've never made it political, I think we have more in common than what we think, a bright and shiny new future And that was the right answer in my view. That experience proved to me that the U.S. has the most thorough refugee vetting system in the world. And while it is true that 2019's homicide numbers were slightly down, November and December were the months that saw the highest number of murders. So what that tells us is that the numbers are surging and that's going to overlap into 2020. I've kept saying it's not about politics, it's about people. But tonight they made it political, and unnecessarily so. You have to be grateful that another officer wasn't shot or killed. 51 people killed in the last 88 days, Greenwood and Carmel and Greenfield and Avon.

Offenders that come to us for probation services after a conviction for an offense are eligible to sign on, volunteer into this Veterans Court. And this is what the left has been doing. They've been calling people racist for 20 to 25 years, and they've watched as Republicans, especially southern conservative Republicans, curl up away from that kind of accusation and it shuts them down. [ Sanders ] was on CNN, Lou Dobbs' show, 2007, directly tying millions of illegal immigrants entering this country, depressing American wages. It's completely contradictory to the rest of his message and to the countries, the Nordic countries that have the similar style socialist systems that he wants to implement.

As the only Member of Iowa's House delegation to vote against these sham impeachment articles, I was feeling pretty lonely until I was joined today by both of Iowa's Senators, Senator Grassley and Senator Ernst, who cast `Not Guilty' votes in the Senate to acquit the President, How did it happen that this is the word that gets tagged on me?

This donation will be a game-changer for many students and their families coping with the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The generous contribution will help young people stay focused on their education at home and until they can return to their classroom. The City of Houston government cannot afford to send hundreds of employees home who cannot do their jobs remotely, And it just slows down the process. We are open and accepting volunteers, criminals take a break, okay. Stay home. Stay home and don't commit any crimes. there is no issue with the food supply chain, All the cases in the Houston area have international travel in common and we've been actively monitoring these individuals since they were identified as being at-risk, I have given no order to shutdown the City. If that happens you will hear it from me, the County Judge or the Governor. Short of that, you are hearing rumors.

If he's right and there are no new cases, and the business community starts to say how amazing that is, then he's going to look like a hero. But the question you have to ask yourself is, do you want a poll tested, you know, staff-driven candidate, or do you want something a little bit more authentic? `Leading America' will expose the reality and hypocrisy of each, and how the president's policies and agenda are fighting back. The other day, she tried to claim victory, and that's ridiculous, because this is probably our last Easter on earth. You can't have it both ways. The same press who want briefings every day can't then complain when they have access to the president and the experts every day. Part of what people like about him is this authenticity, If the biggest thing that you're going to whack them with is that he, you know, mislabeled the Kansas City Chiefs... if that's what we're nitpicking now...

In the House and in the Senate, you will have a bipartisan effort against this entire thing, not for it. That speaks volumes. That's why I think the Democrats are going to have a hard time getting out of this, which is okay. You initiated something in the House, and you laid the predicate that in order to go forward, it needs to be one of the following: one of which they needed to proceed was that it would be bipartisan. Well, it wasn't in your favor. It was bipartisan against you in the House, and then it goes over to the Senate, and it will be bipartisan against there, too. I think when that happens, that's the way that history will judge this, which is it was a purely political act, as opposed to something done based on some violation of the Constitution. That's something I haven't really seen -- in the sense I'm seeing it now -- in previous State of the Union speeches, I'll tell you, as a guy that's 5' 6 ″, that one stung me too, What's killing Biden, while he may still be in the 20s nationally, people know that because he came and did so poorly in Iowa and tonight, it makes it hard to go to donors, If the president is constantly engaging with the press, there's not as much need to be out in front.

Q45940,"A lot of us jumped in... to push back on that and to say, `No, this is this is not what this bill is supposed to be about' and got all of that language stripped out, which was very helpful in the end. It's the same reason (the House) didn't want to hear from the witnesses, apparently, I'm pretty concerned with the House bill making a bad situation worse in our economy, At official events, not so much, This bill is a bipartisan solution to put the best interest of our veterans first while also recognizing that the majority of for-profit post-secondary institutions, but unfortunately not all, offer quality programs that accommodate the needs and unique skill sets of our veterans and service members. The whole room was visibly upset on our side of it. It's insulting and demeaning to everyone to say that we live in fear and that the president has threatened all of us, Federal Fumbles: Ways the Government Dropped the Ball I don't think the State of the Union is the place for it. It's not a tax offset, It's the same reason [ the House ] didn't want to hear from the witnesses, apparently. They made an initial push to be able to say, `Would you come?' [ Potential witnesses ] said, `Yes, if you'll subpoena us, if you'll go through the courts like as a normal process.' And the House said, `No, we're not going to do that, wanted to make sure there was great transparency because they didn't trust the Trump administration. So they built in an inspector general and additional people to watch the Treasury through the process.

This is a different kind of trial, My encouragement would be: if John Bolton's got something to say, there's plenty of microphones all over the country; he should step forward and start talking about it right now, not supportive of individual dollars and grants being targeted toward this industry or this industry. It's a more organized presentation of the same facts. Almost everything we put in there must expire by Dec. 31, 2020, I don't feel an obligation to go search for additional information and additional witnesses and additional pieces beyond what (House Democrats) already sent us, But it was their intention to say that we don't want oil companies to get any support in this downturn.

Iran now knows that President Trump means what he says, and that it cannot afford an all-out war with the United States, which is why it chose not to escalate further. Whether Iran seizes this opportunity to negotiate or not, by killing Soleimani, President Trump has put us in the strongest position we've had with Iran in decades. Now is the time to work with our partners in the region and in Europe on a more comprehensive approach towards de-escalation. That's just a very odd political strategy for them, more than a fact-finding strategy, That is completely, totally false.

Q505598,"It appears that the president and the attorney general have overruled career prosecutors in order to help Roger Stone, who lied under oath on the president's behalf, when the Senate passes this resolution, the ERA will become part of the Constitution. ... executive privilege is a very limited privilege that must be claimed by the President. He has at no time claimed executive privilege. Rather, he has claimed absolute immunity, the nonexistent concept that every Court that has ever considered it has rejected. Instead, he has simply said we will oppose all subpoenas, we will deny to the House all information, all information -- whatever they want, they can't have. Back then, here is what he had to say about impeachment for abuse of power. further proves Mr. Trump's scheme to pressure Ukraine to go after his personal political opponents [ former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter ].

In any trial, all relevant witnesses must be heard. Whether you're accused of robbing a bank, -- testimony that I saw him rob the bank or he was somewhere else, he couldn't have robbed the bank, is admissible. It's not negotiable whether you have witnesses. And this whole controversy about whether there should be witnesses is just -- is really a question of, does the Senate want to have a fair trial or do they -- or are they part of the cover up of the President? How do we know? We know because the president, who is occasionally honest, told us so! The impeachment clause exists to protect our freedom and our democracy in between elections.

It is an unprecedented betrayal of the national interest, Either you want the truth, and you must permit the witnesses, or you want a shameful cover-up, Sadly, the inclusion of a sham waiver process and a couple of non-Muslim majority countries was enough to convince a slim majority of the Supreme Court that a third version of the ban passed constitutional muster, Ambassador Bolton has made clear that he is ready, willing and able to testify about everything he witnessed. But President Trump does not want you to hear from Ambassador Bolton. And the reason has nothing to do with executive privilege or this other nonsense. And the reason has nothing to do with national security. If the president cared about national security, he would not have blocked military assistance to a vulnerable strategic ally in the attempt to secure a personal political favor for himself. No, the president does not want you to hear from Ambassador Bolton, because the president does not want the American people to hear firsthand testimony about the misconduct at the heart of this trial. Any jury would convict in three minutes flat that the president betrayed his country by breaking the law.

McCain himself then gave the dossier to FBI Director Comey. Kramer made sure that the unverified dossier was leaked to media sources before the 2016 election and well after it also.

Q23016975,"I'm awake all day and all night. I talk with Hoosiers border to border and this has rocked their lives. With millions of Hoosiers in the same boat, we have to look out for each other. It's one of the cornerstones of this great nation, and so it stands to reason that rescheduling such an election should only be done in a time of emergency. We couldn't be more grateful for these companies stepping up and contributing in every way they can. They are true examples of how great the Hoosier spirit is. I remain committed to improving infant and maternal health in Indiana so more moms and their babies get off to a better start, with finding permanent homes for children when parental rights have been terminated. I won't go so far to say, maybe I will, to say that you're living in a parallel universe if you don't think this is real. This is real.

Q16146870,"I think what should happen, and my recommendation would be to drop the hammer, don't mitigate the virus, don't spread the curve, shatter the curve, I think what's incumbent is for Sulzberger and the NY Times to reaffirm it's a senior administration official. That means a cabinet secretary, an undersecretary... anybody else is not senior. And that means that they purposely misled the American people about Donald Trump and his fitness for office. the beginning of the end of the managed decline of the United States. Go full hammer on the virus with a full shutdown, use the stimulus to bridge the economic crisis. With this attitude, you know the beauty? We're going to keep winning. I love this. How can you sit here and have a Republican oligarch that is going to be the salvation of the Democratic Party? Bernie has been screwed by the Democratic Party. Look at last week. They wouldn't allow the poll to be released where it showed him up four. As soon as he starts closing in, the Democratic Party steps in and says, `Hey, let's have a re-canvass.

Q1822266,"So he escapes indictment for that narrow fact pattern. But that has nothing to do with FISA and the initiation of Russia and any other potential misconduct that Andy McCabe may have engaged in. That's a really narrow, discrete fact pattern that he's not being indicted for. This never should have been made public and that's why the president is upset. Not at what the intelligence community found, but the fact that Adam Schiff has a beeline to the New York Times when it is negative information about Donald Trump. If you're changing e-mails, manufacturing, altering evidence, It's Adam Schiff's job, if he thinks the testimony of John Bolton is so indispensable then he should have subpoenaed him and the same with Mick Mulvaney and Mike Pompeo and Rudy Giuliani. The Senate's is to deliberate, it is not to investigate and then deliberate, because if that were true we wouldn't need the House. If [ Trump ] doesn't have the Senate, he's essentially a neutered president, Let the judge decide, I think two or three years is about right, Not high marks for following the Democrat talking points. But also you would be hard-pressed to find five members of this jury that have not already made up their mind, nothing happened with respect to the Trump campaign before June of 2016. This was the second call, not the first call. If President Trump were really hellbent on ensuring that Ukraine investigate the Bidens, would he not have brought that up in the first telephone call we had with Zelensky? I mean why wait until the second? But the notion that Bill Barr should resign is about the dumbest damn thing I have ever heard, She can send them and they'll do what they want. But they are not moved by this three-week pause that she has engaged in.

So the judge is going to decide whether or not that enhancement is appropriate -- supported by the facts, We spent two years for Bob Mueller to tell us there was no evidence I've got the transcript. Why do I care what someone who overheard the conversation felt about it or thought about it or believed about it? I can read it for myself. Yes, the whistleblower is relevant, but he's not material. There are 20 witnesses that I think would be more probative than a whistleblower of a transcript that you and I can read for ourselves. South Carolina was never going to vote for somebody that describes himself as a socialist, Senate Republicans should move to acquire jurisdiction and release those articles of impeachment from wherever they are currently imprisoned. And Senate Republicans should set a day certain for the trial to begin, It is a wildly stupid trial strategy, only surpassed by Jerry Nadler's insulting of the jury two days ago. If I were Donald Trump, I'd think the FBI were out to get me too There are child pornographers, people who rob banks who do not get nine years. everyone would agree that Bill Barr's view of the guidelines is accurate. Tucker, that I learned tonight is Jim Comey has a definition of the word `leak' that no on else has. If you didn't have that enhancement, then everyone would agree that Bill Barr's view of the guidelines is accurate. So the judge is going to decide whether or not that enhancement is appropriate -- supported by the facts. Martha, this was a trial. She presided over the trial. She listened to witnesses. She's uniquely well-positioned to decide whether or not that enhancement should be in play, And then find something that's not going to be eroded by the sands of time -- that won't become illegible because it can't be read on a plaque. Do something that perpetuates itself, like life. Why would you trust Adam Schiff for the one-hundredth time? But my sources tell me that is not what he got rid of Maguire. And it was coming anyway, You have James Comey who thinks impeachment is too good for him. You have John Brennan that thinks he should be in the dust pan of history. You have Andy McCabe, who after Comey was fired, launched another investigation into Trump, Surrounded by man's inhumanity toward his fellow man. Surrounded by malignancy and depravity. There is no mathematical way he is ever going to be convicted and they know that, there are child pornographers who don't get nine years. They gather information and make assessments and they give them, unfortunately they give them to people like Adam Schiff who leak like sieves, more than a little angry about all the time and taxpayer money they have wasted the past three years.

Given the importance of this additional evidence, it's understandable that Speaker Pelosi has delayed transmitting articles of impeachment until the contours of a Senate trial are known.

For his determined and aggressive efforts to help others live longer and healthier lives, I'm proud to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci. Yeah, I remember you, Joey. And it [ Saddam Hussein's regime ] has aided, trained and harbored terrorists, including operatives of al Qaeda. Whether Mormon, Methodist, or Muslim, students in America should be able to participate in their constitutional free exercise of religion, new tactics and precision weapons the guilty have far more to fear from war than the innocent. more than four out of five women were illiterate. Right after 9/11, I knew this was going to be an issue in our country. I knew that there would be people that say, `There goes a Muslim-looking person; therefore, that person might be viewed as a terrorist.' I knew that was going to be a problem. That's why I went to a mosque, to send the signal, right after the attacks, that said let's uphold our values. I think when people review what's taken place in the last six months, and put it all in one package, they'll realize how significantly we have moved. The national security team I've put together is the best in our nation's history, fascism, and Nazism, and totalitarianism. moves us backwards on the pathway to equality and integration.

I want to thank all the hard-working Fort Bend County and Access Health employees who are working around the clock to make our community safer for families and especially those most vulnerable to this terrible virus. I pray that more testing will help save lives. Afghan tribes, along with a band of hard-core Islamic fighters known as the Mujahideen, rose up against the foreign occupation. All see, and most admire, the glare which hovers round the external trappings of elevated office. To me there is nothing in it, beyond the lustre which may be reflected from its connection with a power of promoting human felicity. I can prove that Saddam hid weapons of mass destruction; we didn't find any, did we? She was a true Texan, Between 1996 and 2001, bin Laden established camps in Afghanistan that trained an estimated 10,000 terrorists. Go back to the malls. America's immigrant history made us who we are. I do not believe the promises of the Declaration of Independence are just for the strong, the independent, the healthy.

They show that senior U.S. officials were being regularly informed about the scale of the nerve gas attacks. Russia has invaded a sovereign state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people. Such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century. some members of Congress would later claim they were not voting to authorize war but only to continue diplomacy. They must not have read the resolution. The roots of the terrorist presence in Afghanistan traced back to 1979, when the Soviet Union invaded and installed a Communist puppet regime, Shortly after taking power, the radical mullahs offered sanctuary to Osama bin Laden, the founder of al-Qaida, He's making up for lost time by saying, `But here I am today.

This will not be a campaign of half measures, and we will accept no outcome except victory, freedom is a gift of God and the wish of every human heart The underpinnings of the economy are strong.

Q22316,"Why don't we actually talk about how we can do that? How we can guarantee the accountability and the transparency and the mutuality, so that all of us are assured no one is trying to gain an advantage? Now with all due respect to a great group of candidates, Joe Biden's the only person who has been in that situation room for eight years running. Donald Trump had just two bankruptcies Americans are already dying from this in fires, in floods, in storms, in mudslides. And the president is sitting there saying this is a Chinese hoax, entire world view is based on eliminating those who do not subscribe to its perverse ideology When you start running the list. And what is worse, our president, the president of the United States of America, the leader of the of free world goes to meeting of NATO in England and the leaders of the rest of the world are laughing at him So much so that he picks up his marbles like a kid in a schoolyard and goes home and then starts to just tweet in solitude. We are in a dangerous place, and I think people know it. Bernie is regrettably distorting Joe's record, The only team that's worked closer than us is Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, I realized how many powerful people belonging to the previous generation were failing ours. I will never forget the feeling. It animates me still today. It made me angry. It made me an activist. added that donors such as venture capitalist Doug Hickey would have to `raise a couple of million,' and that he would need to leave the board of Bank Of America and stop giving paid speeches. holding accountable those senators who put party, president and personal power over the Constitution and our country. never had a whiff of scandal. Any report otherwise is fucking (or categorically) false. And literally, just before she passed out from pain, Debbi screamed, `Do not let them give me blood, I want you to measure Joe Biden against every single one of the other candidates. They're all great people. Believe me, I know them. I like them. I respect them. Bright, intelligent, thoughtful, capable, will end up in the hands of the IRGC or other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists. This is a complete and total misinterpretation based on overhearing only one side of a phone conversation. A friend who watches too much cable called me wondering whether I'd ever jump into the race late in the game if Democrats were choosing an unelectable nominee, I have always believed there is no need for China and the United States to lead the world to a new Cold War, Democrats need a nominee who understands that the way to beat Donald Trump is to bring people together, We have to stop dealing with questions on Donald Trump's lies and start dealing with the reality of what's going on. That hurt Hillary last time, having Bernie go on and on and on. So we've got to end this thing, and we have a chance to do it. Seventy is the new 50s! So we're in a very dangerous place. Nuclear arms agreements have been chucked away. Though Mr. Trump has since walked back from the brink of war, I can't explain the chaos of his presidency as it lurches from crisis to crisis, real or manufactured It is just unforgivable to sit on the sidelines, This is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs -- 1.6 million jobs, I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC or of other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists to some degree, entirely focused on helping Joe Biden become president. But I got news for you, there's not a veteran here who would take an AR-16 with a long clip to go out and shoot a deer or shoot anything. There is no business -- Joe led the fight to get those things off the street. stop dealing with questions on Donald Trump's lies I don't own one of those now, but one of my reminders of my service is a Communist Chinese assault rifle. If we go back to a 1972 that I remember well when George McGovern was our nominee, It was a hell of a scandal free administration. I am absolutely not running for President. Any report otherwise is categorically false. I've been proud to campaign with my good friend Joe Biden, who is going to win the nomination, beat Trump, and make an outstanding president. tested positive for being an a -- hole.

He's given new meaning to the term #Masshole. (Finally, something the president and I can agree on!) My daughters and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of what's right, what's wrong. They also kick me around. They keep me honest. They don't let me get away with anything.

Q15972549,"If we raise the energy costs for entrepreneurs that need to consume a lot of energy, they have to lay people off. Saving some jobs at a plant won't matter. So we need a balance. How about let's have a wager on the World Series starting tomorrow night in Cleveland. We could just pass the pension reform bill and pass the CPS payment bill, both of which are there. These exist. These don't have to be drafted or negotiated. And it's done. If Illinois were more competitive, if we had just grown Illinois' economy like an average state, today, we would have 650,000 more jobs here, This is a 2 × 4 smacked across the forehead, today without negotiations, without politics, without new changes. There's only one solution that makes sense: give state employees the same rights as the Speaker, rank-and-file legislators and the Attorney General herself, I'm not campaigning saying we have to force unionism and that the union endorsement is what it's all about, My wife and I are going to help them fundraise for the Red Cross for their services here today, I want to say thank you to everyone and encourage everyone to rebuild. God bless and thank you. The Fox River will be cresting at record levels here over the next few days, I am deeply disappointed, very upset about this court filing that Attorney General Madigan has made in St. Clair County seeking to block state employee pay, The final result must be a good deal for taxpayers and job creators: a grand bargain that truly balances the budget once and for all, and really moves the needle when it comes to jobs creation, so frustrating, so disappointing. It's right there in cash. Nothing has to change. But don't be fooled. It's not a solution -- it's a crisis showdown set for June 30 when the Speaker will use the leverage of a forced shut down to finally get the massive tax hike he recommended in December 2015. Speaker Madigan's 32 percent permanent income tax increase will force another tax hike in the near future. I don't take a paycheck -- never have, never will, but I believe state employees who show up to work every day for the people of Illinois should get their paychecks no matter what, For the first time, legislators from both parties are standing together to say that Illinois must have structural change to grow our economy and create good jobs in every part of our state, I hope this is not a direct attempt to cause a crisis to force a shutdown of the government, to force another stopgap spending plan, short-term, unbalanced, incomplete, as a step to force a tax hike without any changes to our broken system. shouldn't pay for Chicago's mess. We save $1 billion for Illinois taxpayers a year and we get $200 million right now for CPS, Obviously the further south, the later the crest will occur and it's going to stay very high at record levels for the next several days. I think we can drive a wedge issue in the Democratic Party on that topic and bring the folks who say, `You know what? For our tax dollars, I'd rather help the disadvantaged, the handicapped, the elderly, the children in poverty. I'd rather have my tax dollars going to that than the SEIU or Af-scammy (AFSCME), who are out there for their own interests. Today, all of us our blue.

There were a lot of vulnerable constituents traveling at the beginning of this pandemic and the federal government has a responsibility to provide clear answers to questions and deliberate action to get them home safely, It is Congress' responsibility to declare war. President Trump should not have taken that action without consulting Congress first, and that is why we are having a debate right now about war powers resolutions, Now, their governor is using the National Guard to deliver food and medical supplies so the tax that will be placed on our service members at large will be more significant than now, and it will continue to grow.

They're trying to take away their civil rights, their human rights, their ability to make the most important, intimate decisions of their lives, President Trump would do better to put experts in charge of this pandemic. President Trump has made poor decisions from the very beginning. At first, minimizing the risk and second denying the risk and third, not moving on the risk. He didn't actually create the resources that would be necessary to deal with this epidemic. He should have allowed testing from January on and not required it to go through the CDC.

Let's try to accomplish something that we can agree on and get it done, If you're [ House Speaker ] Nancy Pelosi and looking at the House majority and you want to get reelected what can you turn to as a real accomplishment? One would be prescription drugs; same as the Republicans over here, address the implications of allowing the House to present an incomplete case to the Senate and request the Senate to seek additional witnesses. additional witnesses are needed. I don't see the evidence that leads to an impeachable offense I believe it sets a dangerous precedent -- all but guaranteeing a proliferation of highly partisan, poorly investigated impeachments in the future -- if we allow the House of Representatives to force the Senate to compel witness testimony that they never secured for themselves. One is those individuals who have to stay home, either because they are ill or because their companies have said you need to work from home, and if you are an hourly employee and you cannot telework, which is the case of a lot of employees, this could be a real hardship. So, I'm looking at legislation that is current law but could be expanded substantially to help provide medical leave for individuals that work for smaller companies where there is not medical leave provided, and I think that is really an issue that needs to be addressed and needs to be addressed now. Because there aren't enough test kits out there, because we need more work on the vaccine, because hospitals in places like Ohio are going to have additional expenses, You're not going to have a product that's signed off by everybody tonight because there's still a couple of outstanding issues, but it will include a lot of Democratic ideas, Given that impeachment proceedings are privileged in the Senate and largely prevent other work from taking place while they are ongoing, please address the implications of allowing the House to present an incomplete case to the Senate and request the Senate to seek testimony from additional witnesses. some of the president's actions in this case -- including asking a foreign country to investigate a potential political opponent and the delay of aid to Ukraine -- were wrong and inappropriate. Testing is also how we'll ultimately overcome this pandemic, because once we have solid data on the scope of the disease, we'll be able to steer our resources where they're needed, and we'll be able to know when it is safe to open up our economy. We still need more equipment and data, but this new machine for UC Health will help. The question is how do we pay for it. We're working on it. a couple of outstanding issues, But maybe.

And he'd be pacing the sidelines of one of his children's sporting events. History shows that bringing tragedies to the public's attention is the greatest catalyst for public policy change. Transparency can lead to enhanced government protections, greater public and private resources, and heightened public understanding and demand for change. We raised a bunch of money, and he was tireless. This is something to work on in Washington (D.C.), but you should be one of the main pathways to 100% coverage.

Administrator Batory is committed to reaching out beyond just Dallas and Houston to hear directly from our landowners and community leaders about the impact on our rural communities including safety worries, damage to our rural countryside, and documented questions about the financial shakiness of this controversial project. I am proud to have been a part of Huntington's ongoing revitalization efforts. I think we should all expect the jobs, the unemployment in the GDP numbers to feel brutal over the short term.

Obviously we want to get [ the COVID-19 ] coronavirus contained [ and ] eliminated as fast as we can, but maybe we can also take this opportunity to use it as a wakeup call that being so dependent -- whether you're talking about military equipment or you're talking about pharmaceutical components or whatever it is you're talking about -- being that dependent upon one country is not a good and healthy thing and we need to diversify our suppliers, I think that ought to alarm all of us who care about this institution and care about our ability to work together on behalf of the country's national security. I look forward to examining the data and arguments the commission has compiled more closely. The civilized world has to try to hold things together, Of course you have instances where you limit debate, you limit amendments, but never has it gone this far so that there is literally no alternative that can be considered, re-programming announced today is contrary to Congress' constitutional authority, and I believe that it requires Congress to take action. It's still a struggle... but it's better now. They needed to know that they could try something and if it failed, they learned, I was persuaded that we had strong intelligence that meant we had to take action, He's not super worked up or anything, just looking for information, but I didn't really have much beyond our timeline here with the apportionment. The greatest national security imperative is to deter any adversary from using a nuclear weapon in any circumstance, But if we can put some ideas out there... then that's a that's a good thing for getting a better bill. It is substituting the judgment of the administration for the judgment of Congress by reducing specific weapons that had been authorized and appropriated. We made a different judgment call than that administration's budget request.

It is politics, but there is institutional damage that is done by playing politics where you will not even allow a differing view from being considered. In the meantime, it is important that my colleagues have an opportunity to hear from the Commission directly. I believe that public hearings in the Armed Services Committee and other relevant committees are essential. What we are seeing is characteristic of what they've done in the past.

In fact, the agencies are always subject to Congress. If Congress doesn't like what they're doing, it can overturn their regulations, as has been done from time to time, The CFPB had two roles. One was to try to prevent an economic collapse of that kind ever happening again, and that was done largely through putting in place rules that safeguarded the mortgage market and ferreted out a lot of the irresponsible and ultimately failed lending that had occurred, That's the mistake she's making: she's a consumer agency, not a financial institution agency.

This is an emphatic statement by the governor that he intends California to be a real leader on consumer protection. saying whatever you do don't strike down the agency as a whole because it would cause chaos in the mortgage market. The rules that are in place, we've all adjusted to those, those are working well. the wrenching experience of the covid-19 pandemic is likely to change many consumers' behavior. It will put California at the forefront of consumer financial protection at the state level... When California makes something a priority, national companies need to respond.

As of now, we're kind of in a holding pattern, General Qassem Soleimani was a bad guy who deserved his fate. No one in Congress is mourning his demise. However, the President's actions have made American lives less safe. Our nation's military is now focused on Iran rather than the threat of the ISIS, 15,000 more troops are in harm's way in the region, and Iran has taken further steps to develop a nuclear weapon.

For we are presented with a clear and simple statute to be judged against a pure command of the Constitution. The outcome can be laid at no door but ours. The hard fact is that sometimes we must make decisions we do not like. We make them because they are right, right in the sense that the law and the Constitution, as we see them, compel the result. And so great is our commitment to the process that, except in the rare case, we do not pause to express distaste for the result, perhaps for fear of undermining a valued principle that dictates the decision. This is one of those rare cases. Though symbols often are what we ourselves make of them, the flag is constant in expressing beliefs Americans share, beliefs in law and peace and that freedom which sustains the human spirit. The case here today forces recognition of the costs to which those beliefs commit us.

Proper management of our forests, to include small prescribed burns, mechanical thinning, and other techniques, will improve forest health and reduce the risk of wildfires, while also helping curb the carbon emissions.
